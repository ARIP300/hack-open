# Identifying Steps for Performance Improvement

Residents were randomized to receive one-on-one coaching in using the feedback tool compared to standard preparation.

# EVALUATION:

Residents in the intervention and control groups completed pre-post surveys assessing self-competence in delivering feedback. Medical students who worked with residents enrolled in the study completed post-surveys assessing the frequency and quality of resident feedback. Trainees who completed assigned surveys, 33 of 48 eligible residents and 35 of 96 eligible medical students, were included in the final data analysis. Regarding the resident surveys, there was no significant difference in the reported frequency of feedback between intervention and control groups. There was a significant difference in self-rated competency setting expectations for feedback, with 83% in the intervention group reporting being "quite competent" or "very competent" in this domain compared to 47% in the control group (p=0.018). While there was no statistically significant difference in self-rated competency in providing formative feedback, there was a trend towards improvement with 76% in the intervention group reporting being "quite competent" or "very competent" in this domain compared to 57% in the control group. Regarding the student surveys, there was no significant difference in the reported frequency or quality of feedback between residents in the intervention or control groups.

# DISCUSSION / REFLECTION / LESSONS LEARNED:

The goal of our intervention was to improve formative feedback provided by residents to medical students. The intervention required a brief orientation session. Residents using the feedback tool reported higher rates of self-competency with regards to setting expectations around feedback, with a trend towards higher rates of self-competency in delivering feedback. Our study was limited by the small sample size of residents, and low survey response rates by medical students.

# MINI-GRAND ROUNDS: A CME SERIES FOR BUSY CLINICIANS

# NEEDS AND OBJECTIVES:

As physicians graduate from residency and enter into clinical practice, they are faced with a deluge of new clinical questions. Similarly, those physicians who have been in practice for many years often times find it difficult to remain abreast with new updates or guidelines. While formal education series such as department wide Grand Rounds assist with continuing education, not all sessions are geared toward the busy practicing generalist. Other perceived barriers to continuing education include learning time, infrastructure as many of our physicians practice in different locations, and opportunity. Our objective is to create a sustainable continuing medical education series pertinent to busy clinicians.

# SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS:

The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center Division of General Internal Medicine consists of 57 physicians and nurse practitioners who work in seven distinct office locations throughout Franklin County.

# DESCRIPTION:

The live conference is held at main practice location with Webex conferencing available to all clinic sites. These sessions are held during the lunch hour twice monthly and are approximately 30 minutes during. Each session answers a pertinent clinical question applicable to the practicing general internist. Sessions are delivered by general internal medicine faculty and are peer-reviewed. CME is awarded to those who attend live either in person or via Webex. Sessions are recorded for future viewing for faculty who cannot attend.

# EVALUATION:

Evaluations are sent to general medicine faculty immediately following each presentation. This provides opportunity for faculty presenters to receive feedback on their teaching. In addition, evaluations are used to track attendance and to receive suggestions for future topics. This is an ongoing project and data are currently being collected.

# DISCUSSION / REFLECTION / LESSONS LEARNED:

We have had preliminary success with implementing a succinct, general internist-focused CME series for a large group practice scattered at different locations. Not only does this series serve to keep faculty current without sacrificing their busy clinical practices, it also acts as a vehicle for peer-reviewed teaching to help with teaching portfolio development. Preliminary data collection suggest faculty find this series beneficial.

# MISTREATMENT BY PATIENTS: A PILOT CURRICULUM BASED ON RESIDENT EXPERIENCES

# NEEDS AND OBJECTIVES:

Mistreatment of physicians by patients is a problem that contributes to burnout. Few educational curricula address this issue for physicians in training. This pilot project sought to characterize resident mistreatment by patients at a Veterans Affairs (VA) and an affiliated university (non-VA) hospital and develop a novel curriculum that provides tools to handle mistreatment.

# SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS:

One 60-minute session was held as a noon conference for PGY 1-3 internal medicine (IM) residents in two settings: VA and non-VA. VA attendees were n = 10 (male = 5, female = 5). Non-VA attendees were n = 16 (male = 12, female = 4). Two IM physician educators were facilitators.

# DESCRIPTION:

Curriculum development was informed by VA residents' experiences with mistreatment. VA residents (n=20) were asked about the prevalence, type, perpetrators and effects of mistreatment; based on this data, we developed an interactive, case-based curriculum related to mistreatment by patients with the following learning objectives: 1. Define resident mistreatment 2. Review the prevalence and forms of mistreatment 3. Discuss approaches to mistreatment by patients as a victim and bystander. Cases included unwanted sexual behavior, racial discrimination, and gender harassment. At the VA, large group discussions required residents to demonstrate use of tools from the literature to approach cases. Due to some attendees' reticence to speak out in this format, the non-VA residents were divided into small groups for case studies, which enhanced open discussions. We developed minute papers for pre- and post-sessions; Likert scales were used to determine mistreatment frequency and comfort level with response to mistreatment.

# EVALUATION:

Mistreatment frequency differed between settings: 70% of VA residents experienced mistreatment frequently or often and 30% experienced it sometimes, while 33% of non-VA residents experienced it sometimes or often and 67% only rarely or never. Pre-session, 70% of VA residents felt uncomfortable or very uncomfortable with their response to mistreatment while only 0-1% of non-VA residents felt uncomfortable or very uncomfortable. Post-session, 90% of residents at both sites felt comfortable or very comfortable handling mistreatment. Residents at both sites were very satisfied with the quality and effectiveness of the presentations. The most helpful aspects were tools reviewed in the session for VA residents and the small group discussions for non-VA residents.

# DISCUSSION / REFLECTION / LESSONS LEARNED:

Results suggest that IM residents were more likely to experience mistreatment by patients in VA compared to non-VA settings. This could be due to a growing mistrust.
