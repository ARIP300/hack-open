Suicide attempts by Black adolescents have surged by 73% between 1991 and 2017 (Sounding the alarm on black youth suicide, n.d.). This has become an area of concern within the psychiatric community but there are no definitive answers as to what caused this increase. Some cite the lack of access to healthcare, mistrust of the medical system, systemic injustice, and shame as possible factors but more research is needed to better understand this phenomenon (Sounding the alarm on black youth suicide, n.d.). Neoliberal policies have disproportionately impoverished minority populations and therefore, must be considered as a possible factor influencing these suicide rates. The neoliberal policy changes contributing to increased poverty rates and poor health outcomes have affected minority populations disproportionately with Black and Latino poverty being three times higher than poverty rates in White populations (Nkansah-Amankra et al., 2013).

Furthermore, neoliberal policies of increased incarceration and harsher sentencing have disproportionately affected minority populations so that minorities are three times more likely to be incarcerated than Whites for the same offense (Nkansah-Amankra et al., 2013). Incarceration has long lasting effects and reduces former offenders’ likelihood of employment, results in poorer mental health when compared to non-incarcerated individuals, and has been shown to strain parenting and long term partnerships (Nkansah-Amankra et al., 2013). A recent study showed that police killings of unarmed Black Americans negatively affects the mental health of Black American adults (Nix & Lozada, 2020). By blaming minorities for their own economic disadvantages, these disproportionate outcomes in minority populations are not by accident and are part of a long history of racism within capitalism.

Political scientist Cedric Robinson described this phenomenon as “racialized capitalism” and that capitalism is structured by “racialism” which is the legitimization of an existing social order by differentiating natural or cultural characteristics of the exploited groups by “races” to justify their exploitation (Issar, 2020). This has taken different forms throughout history in practices such as colonization, slavery, seizure of indigenous land, and housing redlining (Issar, 2020).

# Neoliberal Influence on Mental Healthcare

Neoliberal capitalism does not just increase distress and contribute to rising rates of psychiatric disorders, it also dictates how we go about diagnosis and treatment of mental distress. The way that psychiatry is practiced has been guided by profitability in recent years due to the for-profit healthcare system and influence of the pharmaceutical industry (Davies, 2017). Around the same time as the cultural shifts of neoliberalism began, psychiatry moved to a biological approach and the scope of psychiatry expanded which worked to medicalize distress, shift cultural perception about what is “normal” and what is “abnormal”, and strengthen the idea that failure to succeed in the dominant society is an individual problem that must be corrected by individual treatment (Cohen, 2017).

The statistics from the first section of this paper detailing rising rates of mental illness and antidepressant prescription can be used to illustrate how societal pressures from neoliberalism have caused distress, yet can also illustrate how the...
