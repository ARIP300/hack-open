# BACKGROUND:

Electronic consultations (e-consults) have improved timely access to specialists, but adoption remains incomplete. In areas with inadequate number of specialists, primary care providers may have limited access to e-consults/in-person specialty consultations. Preliminary studies suggest that leveraging the collective intelligence (CI) of multiple clinicians, or the shared intelligence that emerges from collaboration, may provide similar benefits to e-consults. We assessed the accuracy and harm of CI recommendations vs. specialist recommendations in e-consult cases.

# METHODS:

We collected actual endocrinology, neurology, gynecology e-consult cases from a single, integrated healthcare system. Case information was placed on an electronic CI platform, where a board-certified specialist then responded. If cases had gold-standard recommendations (defined as recommendations agreed upon by both the e-consult and CI platform specialists), we then identified a CI by soliciting responses from non-specialty clinicians through the CI platform. The platform aggregated responses into a CI output, which ranked all recommendations. We analyzed the CI output after at least five clinicians responded. The primary outcome was accuracy of CI output against gold-standard recommendations. Accuracy was defined at four levels: focused (all gold-standard recommendations ranked highest); expanded (all gold-standard recommendations ranked high); partial (some gold-standard recommendations ranked high); or none. For the top ten recommendations in the CI output, we assessed as a binary outcome the potential for meaningful harm among non-gold standard recommendations. Two research team clinicians independently assessed accuracy and harm and reached agreement.

# RESULTS:

At total of 227 clinicians answered 33 cases (11 endocrine, 10 neurology, 12 gynecology). A median of 11 clinicians (interquartile range [IQR]: 8-15) responded to each case. Table 1 shows accuracy of the CI output. The number of potentially harmful recommendations per case was: endocrinology (median 1, IQR 1-3); neurology (median 2, IQR 1-2); gynecology (median 2, IQR 1-3).

# CONCLUSIONS:

The CI of multiple clinicians is not equivalent to board-certified specialist recommendations, but it can provide useful recommendations. Some CI recommendations have potential for harm, and clinicians should be wary of higher-risk diagnostic tests/therapies. Future research should address refining CI to safely meet gaps in specialist access.

# CONCORDANCE OF BELIEFS ABOUT CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE, HYPERTENSION, AND DIABETES AMONG PATIENTS WITH MULTIMORBIDITY

# BACKGROUND:

Beliefs about chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and its treatments are important because they influence COPD medication adherence. Comorbidities are common among COPD patients, but it is unknown whether health and medication beliefs for COPD are associated with beliefs for comorbid chronic diseases. Identifying common belief patterns would potentially provide efficient targets for promoting better self-management behaviors for patients with multimorbidity.

# METHODS:

To test the association of COPD illness and medication beliefs with illness and medication beliefs specific to hypertension or diabetes in patients with multimorbidity, we performed a cross-sectional analysis of data collected from COPD patients with comorbid hypertension or diabetes. A sample of 282 adults ages 40 years and older with COPD were recruited from primary care practices in New York, NY, and Chicago, IL. Beliefs about COPD, hypertension, and diabetes were measured using the Brief Illness Perception Questionnaire (BIPQ), with wording adapted to each condition. Higher scores indicate a more threatening view of the illness. Beliefs about COPD, hypertension, or diabetes medications, were measured in two domains (necessity, concerns) using the 10-item Beliefs about Medicines Questionnaire (BMQ). Correlation coefficients were calculated for the associations of beliefs (COPD and hypertension, or COPD and diabetes).

# RESULTS:

The mean age was 68 (SD 9), 59% were female, 38% were black and 17% were Hispanic; 98% had hypertension and 35% had diabetes, and 33% had both comorbidities. Beliefs about illness threat were highly correlated for COPD and hypertension (r=0.52, P<0.0001), and COPD and diabetes (r=0.45, P <0.0001). The correlation was similarly high for COPD and hypertension medication concerns (r=0.64, P <0.0001), COPD and diabetes medication concerns (r=0.61, P<0.0001), and COPD and hypertension medication necessity beliefs (r=0.56, P<0.0001), but less so for COPD and diabetes medication necessity beliefs (r=0.31, P=0.004).

# CONCLUSIONS:

Patients with COPD and comorbid hypertension or diabetes have mostly consistent beliefs about their diseases and the medications used to treat them. This consistency may provide opportunities to utilize patients' illness perceptions and medication beliefs to find strategies that facilitate improved self-management of multiple chronic illnesses.

# CURRENT USE OF SULFONYLUREAS AND INTERACTING ANTIMICROBIALS IN THE UNITED STATES: NAMCS 2006-2015

# BACKGROUND:

Hypoglycemia is the most common serious adverse effect of diabetes treatment and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Sulfonylureas, the most common oral diabetes treatment after metformin, have interactions with a number of antimicrobials which substantially increase the risk of hypoglycemia when prescribed together. In this study, we provide the first nationally representative estimates of the concurrent use of sulfonylureas and interacting antimicrobials, and the indications for interacting antibiotic prescriptions.

# METHODS:

We used the 2006-2015 National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NAMCS), an annual sample of visits to office-based physicians, and National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NHAMCS), an annual sample of visits to hospital emergency departments, and outpatient departments through 2011. Together, these provide nationally representative estimates of U.S. physician visits. At each visit, physicians reported the patient's chief complaint and up to four additional reasons for the visit, as well as the medications ordered, supplied, administered, or continued. This study included visits for adults aged 18 years or older with concurrent use of a sulfonylurea and antimicrobial (excluding topical therapies). The primary outcome was use of antimicrobials interacting with sulfonylureas: clarithromycin, fluconazole, fluoroquinolones, metronidazole, or sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim. We also examined whether the
