Applied to infections (p = 0.0098). These findings support zanubrutinib as an appropriate long-term treatment option for patients with B-cell malignancies.

# Immune cell number changes in long-term treatment

Changes in T cells have been observed during long-term treatment with ibrutinib in CLL patients [20], although it is unclear to which extent these are induced by the inhibition of interleukin-2–inducible T cell kinase (ITK) rather than by the reduction of the tumor burden. Andersson et al. explored the impact of zanubrutinib treatment on T cell and natural killer (NK) cells in 16 patients with CLL who received long-term zanubrutinib therapy compared to ibrutinib. Eight of them had been included in the SEQUOIA trial and were treatment-naïve, while the other eight had been enrolled in the ALPINE study that assessed zanubrutinib in relapsed/refractory disease. After 24 months of follow-up, six patients in each study were still on treatment and had achieved partial response. All patients stayed on full-dose zanubrutinib during the whole treatment period. Taken together, these changes appear to be related to the reduction of the tumor burden rather than to ITK inhibition.

# Overcoming resistance to targeted inhibitors

# Subclonal mutations on covalent BTK inhibitor treatment

As covalent BTK inhibitors have been in use for the treatment of CLL in clinical practice for an extended period of time, different resistance mutations are being observed. Dr. Adrian Wiestner, MD, PhD, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, USA, noted that mutations at progression are variable depending on the specific BTK inhibitor used, with the “classical” C481 mutations prevailing on ibrutinib and acalatinib treatment, while L528W mutations are mainly found in the context of zanubrutinib therapy. This variability is due to different chemical structures of BTK inhibitors that shape the BTK binding properties [1, 2].

CLL with primary resistance to ibrutinib treatment is virtually always transformed lymphoma (i.e., Richter’s transformation, Hodgkin lymphoma; Figure 1) [3]. Progression that occurs later on typically carries BTK or PLCG2 mutations. Dr. Wiestner presented unpublished findings according to which PLCG2 resistance mutations were demonstrated to differ across compartments such as peripheral blood, lymph nodes, and bone marrow. Critical signaling pathways that had been downregulated at the time of response were restored in patients progressing on ibrutinib, with pathway activation being PLCG2 normalized to pre-treatment levels. Additional TP53 aberrations are common in patients progressing on BTK inhibitors. However, they do not represent a resistance mechanism, and successful long-term disease control with first-line ibrutinib is possible in the setting of TP53-aberrant CLL [4]. Similarly, deletion 8p is common in patients progressing on BTK inhibitors.
