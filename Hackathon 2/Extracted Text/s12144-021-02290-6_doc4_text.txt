recovery rate, Malaysia ranked 4th among the ASEAN countries as at 29 April 2020 - Cambodia (97.54%), Brunei (89.95%), Vietnam (83.33%), Malaysia (68.91%), Laos (36.84%), Indonesia (13.18%), Philippines (12.25%), Myanmar (10.67%) and Singapore (7.54%) (Fevre, 2020).

As the number of confirmed cases decreased, the government relaxed the regulations, and the MCO was replaced with CMCO from 4 May until 9 June 2020. Since the number of positive cases was under control during the CMCO, the government replaced the CMCO with the RMCO from 10 June to 31 August 2020; domestic travelling or religious gatherings were permitted, the aims of which were to put the national economy on a recovery path and improve the social wellbeing of the people.

During the MCO, the government shut down non-essential businesses and schools, banned outdoor sports or activities, imposed regulated travel bans, and 14-day mandatory self-quarantine in MoH-designated places for those entering Malaysia (Kaur, 2020). All foreigners or tourists were barred from entering the country to minimize the imported cases (Prime Minister’s Office of Malaysia, 2020). This movement control is similar to those of Taiwan and Singapore. These two countries imposed mandatory quarantine for anyone who entered their land, which successfully curbed the transmission of the virus. As a collective society, Malaysians in general adhere to reasonable instructions from the government as the benefits are clearly explained. Malaysia government also introduced strict enforcement of roadblocks to curb unauthorized travel and ensure people comply with SOPs; penalties were handed down to those who failed to abide by the rules - up to RM1000 fine or/and a jail term of not more than six months (Tanzizi, 2020).

As reported by Timbuong (2020), the Royal Malaysia Police worked with the Malaysian Armed Forces to conduct roadblock operations at key points along the main roads throughout Malaysia, the purposes of which were to prevent unauthorized inter-state and inter-district traveling or traveling of more than 10 km from home. People were only allowed to travel within 10 km from their homes to purchase necessities (Rahim, 2020). As at 9 April 2020, the Royal Malaysia Police had issued 95 summonses with RM1000 fines to those who travelled more than 10 km from home without a working permit from the companies (Palansamy, 2020). High penalties are an effective tool to stop people from going out needlessly, and hence can limit the spread of the virus.

Like New Zealand, Malaysia imposed a full-scale lockdown for the whole nation during the early stage of the COVID-19 outbreak, and enforced strict laws to ensure the people obeyed the instructions. However, Western European countries such as Germany and France imposed partial lockdowns during the early stage of the COVID-19 outbreak. In France, the schools stayed open and outdoor sports were allowed (Thiessen, 2020). Compared with the RM1000 (USD 241) fine imposed by the Malaysian government, the French imposed €135 fine (USD 164) (Palansamy, 2020; Thiessen, 2020). In Malaysia, the minimum monthly salary is approximately RM1200, and the RM1000 fine is more than half of the wage - a pretty heavy fine in compelling individuals to stick to the government-mandated restrictions (Ashley, 2020). Meanwhile, the minimum monthly salary in France is around €1500; the €135 fine is a small fraction of the pay (Perlman, 2019). Consequently, France recorded a total of 129,584 COVID-19 confirmed cases in the country, while Malaysia only recorded 6002 cases as at 30 April 2020 (Worldometers, 2021a, 2021b). Nevertheless, The WHO indicated that France offered the most comprehensive overall health care in the world for the year 2020 (World Health Organization, 2020).

In terms of risk communication, the MoH works with the Malaysian National Security Council (NSC) to disseminate daily updated information about COVID-19 to a broader public through various media. For instance, the MoH has created CRPC KKM Telegram and Facebook pages such as Kementerian Kesihatan Malaysia (Ministry of Health) and Crisis Preparedness and Response Centre (CRCR) (Kaur, 2020; Shah et al., 2020). The CRCR is similar to Taiwan’s CECC that facilitates communication related to COVID-19, to ensure the pandemic information is transparent and available to the public daily. With the free flow of data, people will feel more confident about the government’s ability to curb the transmission of the virus, and allay the fear of out-of-control conditions.

A mobile app, MySejahtera was launched in April 2020 in Malaysia; the public can use it to scan the QR code when entering any premise. In addition, the app provides various pieces of the latest information: statistics of COVID-19 cases in the country and respective states; places that the infected patients had visited; locations of nearest health facilities, and health guides (Malaysia Communications and Multimedia Commission, 2020). This is similar to the TraceTogether app launched by the Singapore government with similar features to track suspected carriers of COVID-19 (Ungku, 2020).

Malaysian government implemented social distancing SOPs during the pandemic outbreak. To decrease the risk of infection, people must maintain a minimum of a one-meter separation between each other. Shops or offices have to place the “1 m” marking on the floor to guide customers on queuing distance. MoH encourages no handshake practices in the workplaces and maintains a one-meter physical space between workers (Ministry of Health Malaysia, 2020). During CMCO, dined is allowed in the restaurant or café but limited to two-person per table to prevent infection (Anis, 2020). The one-meter separation between each other and workplaces social distancing are also implemented in other countries such as Singapore, Taiwan, France, and Germany. It is not a norm to practice social distancing either in high-context or low-context cultures. For high-context cultures such as Singapore, Taiwan, and Malaysia, people valued collectivism and believe that the
