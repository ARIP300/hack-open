# BACKGROUND

Little is known about the prevalence of cancer survivors seen in primary care settings. To provide comprehensive healthcare and care coordination, it is important for primary care providers to understand the utilization patterns, clinical complexity, and specific needs of this growing population.

# METHODS

This retrospective, observational study used electronic health record (EHR) data from 586 safety net clinics, namely community health centers (CHCs), in 20 states, from 2014-2016. CHCs serve a patient population that is largely publicly insured or uninsured, and underrepresented in research. Cancer survivors were defined as adults with a visit to a CHC and a history of malignant cancer; we identified and matched these patients in a 1:3 ratio to patients without a cancer history. We characterized cancer history (primary site, age at diagnosis, time since diagnosis) and compared survivors to their matched counterparts without a cancer history on demographic characteristics, medical complexity, and healthcare utilization. Generalized estimating equation models were used to compute adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for select utilization indicators.

# RESULTS

We identified 45,779 cancer survivors from a population of 1.2 million adult CHC patients (prevalence=3.4%). Most cancer survivors were female (60.8%), with a median age of 61. The leading cancer sites were breast (28.7% of female survivors), prostate (22.9% of males), cervical (8.8% of females), colorectal (7.1% of both sexes), melanoma (5.8%), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (4.3%), and lung and bronchus (4.1%); sex-stratified rankings agreed with national statistics. The median age at diagnosis was 58 (mean=56.9, SD=14.5). Compared to matched patients without a cancer history, survivors had been established with their clinic longer (mean=3.6 years vs. 3.0), had more CHC visits per year (mean=10.8 vs. 7.8), were more likely to be assigned a primary care provider (86.6% vs. 83.2%), and were less likely to be uninsured (13.6% vs 21.6%, p<.001 for all). Cancer survivors had much higher medical complexity, including substantially higher rates of hypertension, depression, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes, and drug/alcohol abuse disorder diagnoses (p<.001 for all). In covariate-adjusted analyses, cancer survivors had 18% higher odds of having any opioid prescribed and 22% higher odds of chronic opioid therapy, relative to matched cancer-free counterparts (p<.001 for both).

# CONCLUSIONS

Cancer history is an important health factor in primary care, as it impacts screening and follow-up recommendations. We found clear differences between CHC patients with a history of cancer and those without. Recognizing and improving the identification of cancer survivors in outpatient EHRs may improve care coordination and appropriate follow-up care.

# CHARACTERISTICS OF PATIENTS WITH DUAL DIAGNOSIS OF SARCOIDOSIS AND RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS IN COMPARISON TO ISOLATED SARCOIDOSIS OR RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS

# BACKGROUND

Sarcoidosis and Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) uncommonly coexist. We propose to understand the features unique to patients with dual diagnosis in comparison to those with isolated sarcoidosis or RA.

# METHODS

We retrospectively searched the electronic medical record at Cleveland Clinic from 2004-2017 for ICD9 and ICD10 codes pertaining to sarcoidosis and RA. Patients were included in our analysis if they had a biopsy-proven diagnosis of sarcoidosis and/or met the 2010 American College of Rheumatology/European League Against Rheumatism criteria for RA. Patients prescribed tumor necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFi) were excluded, as TNFi can cause a granulomatous reaction and induce sarcoidosis. Age-matched controls with sarcoidosis or RA were selected randomly via retrospective chart review in a 1:1:1 ratio. Demographic, clinical, and radiographic information were collected and compared among the three groups using ANOVA, Kruskal-Wallis, Pearson's chi-square, and Fisher's exact tests.

# RESULTS

15 patients met the criteria for the dual diagnosis of sarcoidosis and RA. Patients with dual diagnosis and isolated RA were predominantly female, while patients with isolated sarcoidosis were predominantly male. Those with dual diagnosis presented with lower pulmonary stages compared to isolated sarcoidosis cases, and their sharp scores were lower than isolated RA patients. Despite this, patients with dual diagnosis had more frequent anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) serologies than isolated RA cases.

# CONCLUSIONS

We identified 15 patients carrying both diagnoses, the largest cohort described to date. Those with dual diagnosis were demographically most similar to isolated RA cases, yet they had less joint damage as demonstrated with lower Sharp scores despite more frequent anti-CCP positivity. They also presented with lower pulmonary stages based on the Siltzbach Classification System compared to patients with isolated sarcoidosis. These findings suggest that anti-CCP antibodies may play a role in the pathogenesis of overlapping sarcoidosis and RA. They also suggest that dual diagnosis may protect against severe joint and lung manifestations of the diseases. However, this retrospective study does not account for prior use of disease modifying agents, which may account for the lower disease activity in patients with both diagnoses.

# CHARACTERISTICS OF PATIENTS WHO RECEIVE OPIOIDS DURING AN ACUTE MEDICAL HOSPITALIZATION

# BACKGROUND

Patients often report pain during medical hospitalizations, yet few guidelines exist regarding recommended use of opioids. Nearly half of medical inpatients receive opioids, however little is known about who receives them. The objective of this study was to identify characteristics associated with opioid receipt during an acute medical hospitalization.

# METHODS

This is a retrospective observational study of patients at Cleveland Clinic Hospitals in 2016. The sample included patients with an acute medical hospitalization between 2-30 days who reported pain and excluded ICU stays and pre- or post-operative hospitalizations. For patients with multiple hospitalizations in 2016, one admission was randomly selected. All data came from the electronic health record. Prior opioid use was defined as any opioid prescription in the 30 days before hospitalization. Opioid receipt was defined as any opioid prescription during the hospitalization and analyzed dichotomously. Patient characteristics included age, gender, race, and smoking status. Clinical characteristics included maximum pain score during hospitalization, history of chronic pain or psychiatric diagnosis, length of stay and prior opioid use. Differences in the odds of opioid receipt were assessed using mixed effects logistic regression, accounting for clustering by discharging physician. The model was then stratified by prior opioid receipt.
