# Abstract

This study describes validity and reliability evidence of the Multidimensional Measure of Employability (MME) based on the internal structure and relations to other measures in a sample of unemployed persons in Portugal. Altogether, 216 individuals participated in an online survey. The MME’s internal structure was tested by confirmatory factor analyses, suggesting good fit. The factors’ reliability was good, as assessed by four types of coefficients. Multiple linear regressions considering motivational and emotional features allowed for the identification of validity evidence based on the relationships with other constructs. Thus, MME is a valid and reliable measure to assess employability among unemployed persons.

While economic recession affects everyone, unemployed persons are the most vulnerable to its consequences (Drosos et al., 2021). Thus, tackling unemployment should be a key priority for governments and public authorities. In this realm, career interventions focused on the employability resources of unemployed persons can be
