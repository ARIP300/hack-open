The present work foments and contributes to various scholarly conversations, particularly those involving mental health or ADHD and entrepreneurship (Lerner 2016; Lerner et al. 2018b; Thurik et al. 2016; Verheul et al. 2015, 2016; Wiklund et al. 2016). It also serves as a basis for future research. For example, the finding that individuals with ADHD are almost two times more likely to venture indicates the merit of further studies on ADHD and venturing outcomes. This is particularly so once considering the otherwise squandered human capital, the costs of business failure, and/or the many adverse outcomes associated with unchanneled adult ADHD (such as absenteeism, unemployment, substance abuse, incarceration).

Bolstered by the findings of our large-scale quantitative inquiry, ADHD has implications for organizational research, practice, and policy. Research implications include highlighting the need for further study of contextual factors determining under which conditions ADHD is a strength or a weakness, and is adaptive or counter-productive in venturing. In regard to practice and policy, understanding that mental health, and ADHD in particular, has dark and bright sides for entrepreneurship, has various implications. For example, it suggests the opportunity for research to help educators, clinicians, and even organizations focus on strengths (such as a willingness to act, an imperturbable focus on activities of interest) and compensate for weaknesses (such as distractibility and poor attention to detail in mundane activities). More generally, it suggests the continued opportunity for considering other predictors seen as aberrant in respect to entrepreneurship (e.g., Hmieleski and Lerner 2016; Wiklund et al. 2018).

Overall, the present work contributes to theory by grounding recent research linking ADHD and entrepreneurship with a large-scale quantitative examination that squarely tests the effect of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder. In concert with other studies, the work establishes an emergent entrepreneurship literature on ADHD. In doing so, it attests to broader emerging theory that suggests the relevance of clinical or otherwise dark constructs in entrepreneurship.
