# ABSTRACTS

included ESR 42, CRP 6.6, normal complement levels, negative cryoglobulins, negative anti-phospholipid screen, normal urinalysis, and negative blood cultures. Echocardiogram showed no vegetations or thrombi. Upper extremity duplex revealed no flow in the distal ulnar artery. Angiogram showed distal ulnar occlusion, poor palmar arch filling, but with flow to all five digits. Upon further review of his occupational history, the patient stated that he is a construction worker and often uses drilling machinery. He was diagnosed with hypothenar hammer syndrome. He was initially treated with nifedipine and clopidogrel, but ultimately underwent amputation and botox injection.

# IMPACT/DISCUSSION:

Hypothenar hammer syndrome is a rare clinical entity that results from repeated trauma to the ulnar artery. It is typically described in middle-aged men whose occupation involves repetitive use of the hand. Metal workers, carpenters, auto mechanics, and constructions workers are some examples of those at increased risk. The ulnar artery branches off to the deep and superficial palmar arch at Guyon's canal. The superficial branch is the main blood supply for most fingers and crosses over the hypothenar muscles before penetrating the palmar aponeurosis. At this segment it is very susceptible to injury. Repetitive trauma can cause intimal damage and induce vasospasms, encouraging platelet aggregation and thrombus formation. Aneurysm may also form with damage to the arterial wall, limiting blood flow to the hand. Clinical presentation varies depending on the severity of damage. Patients may complain of a palpable mass, vasospasm, paresthesias, hypothenar pain, or coolness and discoloration of the fingertips. Generally, symptoms are unilateral and the thumb is spared. Severe disease presents as gangrene or eschar formation at the fingertips. Similar symptoms may be seen in Raynaud's disease, thromboangiitis obliterans, and connective tissue disorders, however, these patients typically have bilateral upper extremity involvement. Initial workup includes a thorough physical exam and Doppler ultrasound, but the gold standard test for diagnosis is angiography. Treatment may include lifestyle modifications, calcium channel blockers, antiplatelet agents, and Botox injection. Severe cases warrant vascular surgery.

# CONCLUSION:

Hand pain is a very common complaint in the outpatient population. Usually the underlying origin is musculoskeletal, but vascular injury should remain on the differential. A detailed review of occupational history and thorough physical examination are crucial. Physicians should be prudent to consider hypothenar hammer syndrome especially in patients that report occupational or recreational trauma to the hypothenar region.

# IT'S NOT A TUMOR! A CASE OF NECROTIZING SARCOID GRANULOMATOSIS

# LEARNING OBJECTIVE #1:

Recognize the clinical features of necrotizing sarcoid granulomatosis

# LEARNING OBJECTIVE #2:

Describe the differential diagnosis for pulmonary granulomatous diseases

# CASE:

A 71-year-old female retired veterinarian with a history of seasonal allergies presented to the hospital with 5 weeks of worsening dyspnea on exertion, which now confined her to a recliner. She also reported a dry cough, orthopnea, anorexia, and a 40-lb weight loss over 3 months. She lived on a farm with numerous animals and vacationed in Mexico every year. She required 3L oxygen at rest, and her O2 saturation fell to 74% with minimal activity. On lung exam she had diminished breath sounds and inspiratory crackles at the bilateral bases. Initial labs were notable only for mild anemia, hyponatremia, and low albumin. Chest CT revealed innumerable ill-defined pulmonary nodules diffusely as well as irregular intralobular septal thickening, bilateral pleural effusions, and mediastinal lymphadenopathy, which was thought to be consistent with lymphatic spread of tumor. Thoracentesis revealed an exudative effusion with negative culture and cytology. A bronchoscopy with endo- and trans-bronchial biopsies showed non-caseating granulomas with negative cultures (including acid-fast bacilli) and cytology. Additional laboratory testing included interferon-gamma release assay, anti-nuclear antibody, anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody, and serologic studies for multiple fungal organisms, all of which were negative. A video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) with wedge biopsy was performed, which revealed sarcoid-like granulomas with focal central necrosis and accompanying granulomatous inflammation involving pulmonary vasculature and lymphatics. The patient was diagnosed with necrotizing sarcoid granulomatosis (NSG). She was treated with high-dose corticosteroids with marked symptomatic and radiographic improvement in less than one month.

# IMPACT/DISCUSSION:

NSG is a rare and poorly understood form of pulmonary granulomatous disease that was first described in 1973. Approximately 130 cases have been reported. It may present with fever, cough, dyspnea, chest pain, and weight loss, though patients are asymptomatic in as many as 25% of cases. Based on its tumor-like appearance, NSG is often mistaken for malignancy. Diagnoses such as sarcoidosis, granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), tuberculosis (TB), and fungal infections are also on the differential, among others. NSG is characterized on histopathology by sarcoid-like granulomas, vasculitis, and a variable degree of necrosis. While no consensus guidelines for treatment exist, corticosteroids, lung resection, and watchful waiting have been employed. Prognosis is typically good.

# CONCLUSION:

1. NSG is a rare disease characterized by sarcoid-like granulomas, vasculitis, and necrosis.
2. It presents with diffuse lung nodularity and is often mistaken for malignancy.
3. The differential diagnosis includes sarcoidosis, GPA, TB, and fungal infections.

# LEARNING OBJECTIVE #1:

Recognize risk factors associated with ischemic colitis.

# CASE:

A 72-year-old gentleman with past medical history significant for end-stage renal disease on intermittent hemodialysis, heart failure with reduced ejection fraction of 30-35%, atrial fibrillation, and hypotension presented with one day of new lower abdominal pain. The day prior to onset of symptoms he had an episode of hypotension during dialysis. He reported a history of recurrent hypotension resulting in chronic use of midodrine. The patient stated the abdominal pain awoke him from his sleep, describing it as a severe pressure-like sensation. He had a history of chronic constipation, otherwise denied any episodes of nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, melena, or hematochezia. The patient had no history of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use. His last colonoscopy and EGD approximately 3 years ago reported normal. On admission, labs significant for hemoglobin 12.9, white blood cell count 13.9, platelets 126, and lactate 1.9. CT abdomen and pelvis without contrast revealed uncomplicated cecal colitis without evidence of obstruction and normal mesenteric vasculature. The patient was empirically started on antibiotics and placed on bowel rest. However, despite conservative management the patient's symptoms persisted and repeat CT abdomen and pelvis with contrast 3 days later revealed an eccentric, irregular cecal wall thickening concerning for malignancy with surrounding inflammatory stranding and edema. Subsequently the patient underwent colonoscopy the next day revealing an ulcerated partially obstructing large cecal mass that involved the entire cecum and the wall across from the ileocecal valve. Biopsies were collected during colonoscopy and colorectal surgery was consulted thereafter for presumed malignancy. However, there was no evidence of malignancy on histopathology. Repeat colonoscopy was completed for
