# The RCT

# Target group, recruitment and randomization

The target group for the intervention was GPs and RCs at the included PHCCs, and by extension their patients, sick-listed from work due to a stress-related diagnosis. The recruitment of PHCCs took place between January and October 2016. A first request to the PHCCs to participate were communicated by telephone calls, e-mails and personal meetings with PHCC managers throughout the Västra Götaland region. In order to attain diversity in terms of geographical location, public or private ownership, center size, and the socioeconomic conditions of the area, interested centers were checked against regional register data. We also considered the number of patients with a F43 diagnosis at the center during one year (2015), the center’s involvement in other research projects, and the extent of RC resources at the center.

Out of the 30 public and private PHCCs that were invited to participate, 22 accepted; 15 public and seven private centers. Managers accepted the center’s commitment by signing a contract with the researchers. Managers were asked to make sure that the entire staff agreed to the center’s participation in the study before signing the contract. The researchers visited each center to inform the staff about the study prior to commitment. PHCCs were offered economic compensation for recruited patients; € 50 per patient in the control group and € 100 per patient in the intervention group. Also, all centers were offered the one day training program, however they were informed that if allocated to the control group, they would have to wait until all patients were recruited to the study.

Based on similar characteristics in register data, we matched centers in pairs. From each pair, one center was randomly selected to the intervention group and the other one to the control group. The staff of the participant centers were all aware about their allocation in the RCT, blinding was not possible in this study.

Employed patients with a F43 diagnosis as the main diagnosis, getting their sickness certification renewed were eligible for participation. Excluded were patients with post-traumatic stress disorder, F43.1. Patients who did not read or speak Swedish, and patients who have had a sick-leave period of more than 60 subsequent days during the past three years before inclusion were not asked to participate.

# The intervention

The intervention consisted of three components: a one-day training for all participant GPs and RCs, a standardized work procedure for GPs and RCs to follow after training, and the possibility to seek clinical advice from specialist physicians in the research group. The design of the intervention was guided by occupational therapy theory, where occupational performance is regarded as the outcome of a continuous interaction between the person (P), the environment (E) and the occupation (work tasks) (O) [30]. The PEO-model suggests that in order to improve occupational performance, therapists must direct their interventions not only to the individual, but also to the individual’s environment and occupation. In rehabilitation, therapists can assist in for example the adjustment of work tasks, regulation of spare time activities, and modification of the work environment so that the employee can keep work capacity despite physical or mental symptoms and impairments. This requires a shift away from a biomedical perspective to a more holistic approach which takes the patient’s situation into consideration.

In order to enhance knowledge about the relationship between work; stress-related disorders; work capacity and RTW among GPs and RCs, a one day’s training was compulsory for the participants in the intervention group. Lectures and workshops were conducted by researchers who are also experienced clinicians (physicians, psychologists and occupational therapists). The participants were taught both why and how the employer can be involved at an early stage in the rehabilitation of patients with stress-related disorders. The training day was offered at six occasions from November 2016 to September 2017. GPs (n=66) and RCs (n=13) from the eleven intervention centers underwent training.

The intervention’s central component was a standardized procedure of four steps involving the patient, the GP, the RC and the patient’s employer. This procedure was based on the clinical experience from twelve years of treating patients with exhaustion disorder at the Institute of Stress Medicine [31], and adapted to the primary health care setting, in dialogue with GPs and RCs prior to the intervention. Ordinary medical and psychological treatment and rehabilitation (TAU) was conducted parallel to this procedure.

When a GP had identified a patient for inclusion (step one), the RC set up a meeting with the patient. During this meeting, the RCs informed the patient about the study and collected his or her written consent. The patient filled out a questionnaire containing questions on background characteristics, occupation, symptoms, work stressors and private life stressors, work ability, RTW self-efficacy, employer activities, RTW motivation, and general health (see Table 2). The questionnaire took about 30 minutes to fill in. Patients declining participation were asked to fill in their year of birth, gender and occupation. The RC then used the questionnaire to interview the patient for about one hour (step two), scanned the questionnaire to the medical journal, and provided the GP with a summary. In the next step (step three), the RC called the patient´s employer and filled...
