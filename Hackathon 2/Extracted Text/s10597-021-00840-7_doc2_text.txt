# Neoliberal Policy and Mental Illness

As stated above, neoliberal capitalism has led to an increase in inequality and worsened working conditions. Although cost of living increased, wages have remained stagnant requiring minimum wage workers to work more hours to cover their living expenses (Mishel & Kandra, 2020). With blue-collar labor replaced by cheap foreign alternatives, manufacturing jobs can no longer offer the stability or opportunities for advancement enjoyed by previous generations, (Case & Deaton, 2020). Furthermore, jobs that are available to those without college degrees are service jobs often outsourced to staffing firms that don’t provide workers with adequate benefits, long term contracts, or opportunity for promotion (Case & Deaton, 2020). Outsourced labor and increasingly popular gig work do not provide workers with the stability, social cohesion, and meaning that were once provided by direct employment by companies and manufacturing jobs (Case & Deaton, 2020).

In recent years there has been an increased focus on social determinants of health and widespread acceptance that there are strong associations between poverty and mental illness (Allen et al., 2014). The World Health Organization’s 2014 report Social Determinants of Mental Health showed that common mental disorders such as anxiety and depression are distributed along an economic gradient (Allen et al., 2014). The report suggests that people with lower socio-economic status are more likely to be exposed to adverse childhood experiences increasing the likelihood of mental illness (Allen et al., 2014). This is one potential explanation for rising rates of mental illness as a consequence of increased poverty or “near poverty” from wage stagnation and fewer welfare programs (Cohen, 2017; Nkansah-Amankra et al., 2013). However, in their book The Spirit Level, Richard Wilkinson and Kate Pickett show that inequality also seems to have a large impact on mental health for everyone regardless of social class (Wilkinson & Pickett, 2011).

In 1996, President Clinton signed the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act putting stricter requirements on traditional welfare such as a five-year limit for benefits, stricter eligibility, and work participation requirements (Hansen et al., 2014). Changing these policies did not decrease the need for financial support, so the many of the people who needed assistance applied for Social Security income (SSI) instead (Hansen et al., 2014). This can be seen through the dramatic increases in Social Security recipients since 1996 which reached a 50–100% growth in the number of young adult beneficiaries by 2000 (Hansen et al., 2014).

Other recent developments that can be attributed as phenomena of neoliberal capitalism, such as the loss of meaningful work and worsening job opportunities for working-class people, may contribute to increasing rates of mental illness (Hari, 2019). People in the US are working longer hours and are increasingly unsatisfied with their jobs (Hari, 2019). In their recent book Deaths of Despair and the Future of Capitalism, economists Anne Case and Angus Deaton track recent corporate and government practices that effect the working class, which they believe have led to the increased death rates from suicide, drug overdose and alcoholic cirrhosis since 1999. These combined rates were much higher in working-class white people without a college degree (Case & Deaton, 2020).
