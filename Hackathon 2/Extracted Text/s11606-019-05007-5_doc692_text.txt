# ABSTRACTS

residents enjoyed BAM! and found it important to their training. Given the increasing need for providers who are able to effectively treat SUDs, courses such as BAM! are an effective and essential part of residency. Further studies are needed to assess if the changes in residents' attitudes persist and whether we influenced practice.

meaningful clinical examples improved resident engagement. Overall our approach was highly rated by resident learners. Future work will expand EBM across a three-year curriculum to reinforce key concepts and further develop critical appraisal skills.

# NEEDS AND OBJECTIVES:

The learning and practice of evidence based medicine (EBM) is a critical component to internal medicine residency education. Despite dedicated sessions to support EBM skill development, traditional journal club formats have failed to engage learners and foster conceptual understanding. Results of an internal needs assessment identified several areas to target including residents' understanding of probability, interpreting test results, and developing answerable clinical questions using the literature. Given that residents reported feeling disinterested in the current EBM curriculum, we aimed to deliver content in a way that actively engaged resident learners and addressed knowledge gaps.

# SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS:

Seventy-two categorical internal medicine residents at the University of Rochester participated in a revised EBM curriculum delivered during dedicated ambulatory educational half-days. Ambulatory education is protected time from clinical duties held weekly during two-week ambulatory blocks. All residents have at least six blocks of ambulatory medicine per year.

# DESCRIPTION:

The revised EBM curriculum consisted of six one-hour sessions over one year. The sessions incorporated interactive lecture utilizing audience response and problem-based learning to apply EBM concepts to clinical settings. Sessions topics included: 1) recognition of overconfidence and understanding probability; 2) test interpretation; 3) study design; 4) asking a clinical question; 5) abstract review; and 6) feedback and skills assessment.

# EVALUATION:

Sixty-eight residents completed the Fresno test of EBM competence at the end of the year-long curriculum and had a mean score of 124 - a value between novice (95.6) and expert (147.5) categories. Resident evaluation further showed that the EBM curriculum was well received, with an overall course rating of 7.8 (SD 1.8) on a Likert scale ranging from 1 to 10 (best). Resident comments supported the numeric score: "EBM this year has been much better than the last 2 years. It was focused on the basic, relevant things we need to know"; "I have enjoyed the back to the basics nature as opposed to reading articles and trying to apply topics we don't truly understand."

# DISCUSSION / REFLECTION / LESSONS LEARNED:

Resident physicians begin residency with varying familiarity of EBM concepts. Although traditional models of journal club help to facilitate a critical review of the literature, residents may still lack an appropriate foundation to apply EBM skills. Further, many residents were unaware of knowledge gaps. Thus, highlighting learner needs served to emphasize the value of the curriculum. The first session purposely challenged learners' understanding of EBM while remaining well received. Linking EBM concepts to different topics over three years also avoids redundancy and helps to maintain interest and focus on cost-conscious, high value care throughout the three-year training program.
