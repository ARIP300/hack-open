illness, the spread of vector-borne diseases, respiratory diseases caused by air pollution, malnutrition, forced migration, and mental health43. An unfavorable fact is that the mortality rate attributed to the damaged environment accounts for one-fourth of the total mortality rate44.

According to research in environmental psychology, environmental perception takes shape from the process of communication between humans and nature and reflects individuals’ attitude with regard to the environment45. Climate change health risk perception (CHRP) points to a way that individuals or organizations perceive the latent and obvious health risks associated with climate change, and then form a subjective judgment of the probability and severity of these events, which consists of the following three primary parts-how to handle information about risks related to climate change, how to perceive these risks, and how to respond to these risks46. For hospital workers, CHRP is to identify the health issues caused by climate change and take proactive actions to avoid these events47. Hence, CHRP can be a momentous factor to predict whether people are willing to take action to mitigate climate change and address health problems such as anxiety and depression48. Nevertheless, risk perception is diverse and unstable since it can appear or disappear varying from different geographical and demographical features49. How to increase the health risk perception of climate change is an emerging field that has not yet been fully elucidated. It is not enough to make efforts by governments and public institutions alone, scholars focusing on environmental protection should explore the influencing factor of risk perception and try to clarify the relationship between them. There are several influencing factors of CHRP such as the level of environmental knowledge, personal experiences with extreme weather events, and environmental beliefs and values50–52. Additionally, according to social amplification theory, health risk can be magnified in the communication process, ultimately, people’s risk perception is deepened and they are more willing to take effective actions to protect the environment53. Overall, understanding how to perceive climate change health risks is important for developing effective methods to promote the adoption of more actual PEB.

Based on the IAB, individuals’ perception has a significant influence on their attitude and certain behavior54. When facing diverse health risks, the more menaces are perceived by hospital workers, the more actions are taken to alleviate these risks54. In addition, information has a direct influence on individuals’ perception, the information about climate change also can shape individuals’ health risk perception and contribute to the adoption of PEB55,56. Every hospital makes huge contributions to environmental issues in the progress of diagnosis, treatment, and management diseases. Moreover, energy consumption and carbon emission of hospital are high9 due to operating around the clock57. At present, numerous regulations and plans focusing on energy saving and emission reduction have been formulated in the healthcare process, for example, using a digital medical record system to reduce the demand for paper, this not only helps save paper, but also reduces energy costs for transferring files58. When considering the possible health risk of climate change, hospital workers will regard these risks as the outcome of their medical practice and daily activities, and they will be willing to take more effective measures to minimize these risks and promote everyone’s health. In short, the reason for supporting risk perception research is that it reflects people’s preferences, underlying values, and information concerning risk.

In China, due to its diverse climatic characteristics and unbalanced socio-economic development, climate change poses greater health risks59. These risks are perceived by individuals in various ways due to the difference between the working environment and personal experience60. However, current studies generally focus on the public or recognized sensitive groups such as farmers61, the risk perception of hospital workers is missing, which poses higher risks and threatens human health directly and indirectly62. For hospital workers’ CHRP, what differences exist and how to improve it remain confusing. The study of hospital workers’ CHRP is significant, such as decline in climate change related diseases, decrease in medical expenditures, optimization the use of medical resources, and promotion public health63. Hence, this study aims to clarify the relationship between CHRP and PEB, and to explore how CHRP affects hospital workers’ PEB. In the light of above discussions, we propose the following hypothesis:

# Hypothesis 1

Hospital workers’ climate change health risk perception has a significant positive effect on pro-environmental behavior.

The IAB also points out that individuals’ perception has a significant influence on personal attitude and then changes certain behavior54. The study of O’Connor, Bard64 suggested that individuals with higher risk perception are more positive to deal with environmental issues. Additionally, there is a study that believes the risk perception shaped by information from surrounding people and the internet can change individuals’ attitude positively toward green purchasing behavior65.

Dawson54 also gave the same conclusion, environment related risk perception can influence indirectly people’s PEB via the mediating role of attitude. In China, the problem of environmental pollution is becoming increasingly prominent with the development of the economy, the public shows a high level of risk perception and a positive attitude to address these issues66. Moreover, Ban, Shi67 indicated that the more latent risks of climate change such as heat wave are perceived, the more willing appear to mitigate these issues. Based on the same logic, it is reasonable to speculate that hospital workers perceiving higher health risks are more willing to take effective measures to reduce those risks. Thus, the following hypothesis is proposed:

# Hypothesis 2

Hospital workers’ climate change health risk perception has a significant positive effect on pro-environmental attitude.

According to the TPB, intention is a direct predictive factor for specific behavior, hence, it can serve as a mediator to affect the relationship between other influencing factors and actual behavior24. By the same token, the causal relationship between CHRP and PEB may be mediated by intention. Yoon, Jeong68 mentioned that
