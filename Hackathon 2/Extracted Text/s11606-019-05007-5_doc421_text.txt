and mucinous tumors such as ovarian, pancreatic and gastric. Our patient had prostate cancer induced DIC. The pathophysiology involves release of polyphophate containing protasomes from prostate gland which activates Factor XII leading to DIC. Management should focus on supportive measures to correct the coagulopathy and treatment of underlying cause. Our patient received anti-androgen therapy bicalutamide and leuprolide with improvement in PSA and DIC.

# CONCLUSION:

DIC can be an initial manifestation of underlying prostate cancer. It is important to monitor the patients with metastatic prostate cancer for signs and symptoms of development of DIC such as bleeding or low platelet counts. The management of DIC must be to control coagulopathy with supportive measures (such as platelet transfusion, cryoglobulin) and treatment of underlying cause.

# DISTINGUISHING BETWEEN ERYTHEMA MULTIFORME MAJOR AND SEVENS JOHNSON SYNDROME: A DIAGNOSTIC CHALLENGE

Amali Gunawardana1, 2; Ribka Ayana1; Mary Maiberger1. 1Washington DC VA Medical Center, Washington DC, DC; 2George Washington University Hospital, Washington, DC. (Control ID #3184120)

# LEARNING OBJECTIVE #1:

Recognize the clinical distinction between Erythema Multiforme Major (EMM) and Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS)

# LEARNING OBJECTIVE #2:

Recognize the difference in morbidity and mortality associated with EMM vs. SJS

# CASE:

A 62-year-old hospitalized male complained of a burning, tender blister on his upper lip. Three days prior, he was started on vancomycin and ertapenem for urinary tract infection and osteomyelitis though after, ertapenem was changed to meropenem for persistent fevers. Acyclovir was started for suspected herpes infection, but his lesions progressed. Dermatology evaluated the patient and noted multiple superficial ulcerations and erosions involving the upper and lower lips, buccal mucosa as well as thin fissuring of the lower lip. Oral examination revealed grayish-white mucosal desquamation of the hard palate. In addition, he had focal erythematous, dusty plaques scattered over several digits on both hands. There was no ocular or genital involvement. Patient declined a skin biopsy. A clinical diagnosis of EMM was made, and vancomycin and meropenem were discontinued. Lesions slowly resolved and patient completed treatment course with clindamycin and aztreonam.

# IMPACT/DISCUSSION:

First, drug-induced EMM is an uncommon variant. Second, to our knowledge, there exist no cases of vancomycin or carbapenem induced EMM reported in the literature. Lastly, in early stages, severe EMM and SJS can be confused, though early clinical distinction is critical as management strategies vary, and SJS is associated with a higher morbidity and mortality.

# CONCLUSION:

EMM is a mucocutaneous eruption characterized by targetoid lesions in an acral and mucosal distribution, categorized into two subtypes (major and minor) based on the severity and number of mucosal sites involved. Most commonly caused by infections, such as herpes simplex virus infection and mycoplasma pneumoniae, it is less commonly triggered by medications such as sulfonamides, NSAIDs, and anticonvulsants. EMM is a distinct clinical syndrome from SJS/toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) which are more severe desquamating mucocutaneous drug reactions. SJS and TEN are often drug induced reactions. The degree of mucosal involvement is typically limited to 1-2% of body surface area in EMM, up to 10% in SJS and greater than 30% in TEN. SJS is more likely associated with lesions starting on trunk and spreading distally in contrast to EMM, and lesions appear more like atypical targetoid macules or purpuric papules. SJS/TEN patients are more likely to have fever, skin detachment, and ocular manifestations and require treatment with immunosuppressive. EMM is a clinical diagnosis, although biopsy can support clinical findings and help exclude other causes. EMM is usually self-limited and resolves in 3-5 weeks, though can reoccur.

# LEARNING OBJECTIVE #1:

Recognize Miller Fisher Syndrome (MFS) as a variant of Guillain-Barre (GBS)

# LEARNING OBJECTIVE #2:

Maintain low threshold to perform lumbar puncture in a young patient with unusual neurological presentation

# CASE:

A 49-year-old male with no significant medical history presented with sudden onset drooping of the left eyelid and diplopia looking into the right. He was recently treated for sinusitis with antibiotic. He was seen a week prior with upper and lower extremity numbness and unsteady gait, CT head was unremarkable, his symptoms improved but he was still using a cane for support. He denied any focal weakness or incontinence. He is married, works in foundation repair, and denies recent travel or tick bite. Vital signs were normal. He had left partial ptosis. Left eye was directed downward and outward and unable to adduct. Left eye pupillary reflex was intact. Other cranial nerves were normal. Had normal power and sensation, no cerebellar signs, absent deep tendon reflexes and slightly unsteady gait with inability to perform tiptoe walk. Romberg sign was negative. Laboratory workup was unremarkable. MRI showed no demyelinating lesion. Lumbar puncture showed normal cell count with total protein of 157 mg/dl (Ref. Range 15-45). MFS was suspected, the patient was started on intravenous immunoglobulin for 4 consecutive days, with remarkable improvement in eye movement noted by the time of discharge.

# IMPACT/DISCUSSION:

MFS is a variant of GBS, characterized by the triad of ophthalmoplegia, ataxia and areflexia. Incomplete forms with 2 out of the three features do exist. CSF is often diagnostic with the characteristic cytoalbuminologic dissociation. Antibodies against GQ1b (a ganglioside component of nerve) are present in 85 to 90 % of patients. Most of the patients do recover, with a mean recovery onset at 10 weeks. Immunomodulatory treatment has been used to hasten recovery. Intravenous immunoglobulin, as used in our patient, have proved equally effective to plasma exchange. The initial presentation of our patient was a bit challenging, especially with normal motor function and reflexes. Gait instability and recent upper respiratory symptoms may have misled to vestibular neuritis as a probable cause. MFS as the likely diagnosis was not apparent until after he was readmitted with partial third nerve palsy and areflexia.

# CONCLUSION:

This case illustrates how important the clinical judgment in assessing someone who presents with complex neurological complaints. In young patients like ours, it helps to maintain a low threshold to perform lumbar puncture and CSF analysis whenever there is uncertainty about the diagnosis.

# LEARNING OBJECTIVE #1:

Recognize a rare etiology of pericardial effusions and possible treatment modalities

# CASE:

A 65-year-old male with a history of hypertension presented with 2 weeks of shortness of breath and dyspnea on exertion along with orthopnea and a dry cough. He denied any chest pain, weight loss, fevers, or night sweats. On examination, vital signs were stable and he was saturating well on room air. He had jugular venous distension, distant heart sounds, and lower extremity edema. Laboratory values were within normal with the exception of alkaline phosphatase 558 U/L, AST 137 U/L, ALT 88 U/L, T Bili 1.4 mg/dL, D Bili 0.7 mg/dL, and a mildly elevated pro-BNP to 804 pg/ml. HIV and hepatitis panel was negative.
