Substance misuse and substance use disorders (SUDs) represent one of the critical public and occupational health issues of our time and impose enormous costs on American society (Office of the Surgeon General, 2016). In terms of annual economic costs, alcohol misuse and disorders cost approximately $249 billion in 2010 (Sacks et al., 2015). Additionally, illicit drug use and disorders, which involve illegal drug and nonmedical prescription medication use, cost approximately $193 billion in 2007 (National Drug Intelligence Center, 2011). Recently, Davenport et al., (2019) estimated that the direct and indirect economic cost of nonmedical opioid use alone amounted to $188 billion in 2019. These societal costs involve reduced employability, employment‑ and nonemployment‑related lost productivity, health care expenses, morbidity and mortality, and criminal justice. Regarding mortality, the total number of U.S. drug overdose deaths rose from 16,849 to 1999 to 70,630 in 2019, primarily driven by increases in overdoses involving opioids, including dangerous synthetic opioids like fentanyl (Hedegaard et al., 2020). The average annual number of deaths from alcohol‑associated causes from 2011 to 2015 was approximately 95,000 (Esser et al., 2020). Finally, Table 1 shows that 70.4% (about 13.6 million workers) of all adults with an alcohol or illicit drug use disorder are employed. Among employed adults, 8.7% (about 13.6 million workers) have current alcohol or illicit drug use disorders, 1.2% (about 1.9 million workers) receive some type of treatment annually for a SUD, and 8.5% (about 13.3 million workers) report that they are in recovery or have recovered from a past or present substance use problem. These details show that SUDs affect a relatively small proportion yet a significant number of individuals in the workforce (see Table 1).

Growing evidence supports that recovery from a SUD is achievable and benefits workplaces and society (Akhtar, 2019; McQuaid et al., 2017; Whitney, 2016). It is also essential to consider that attempts to recover from SUDs occur in environmental contexts that may support or undermine its initiation and sustainability. One environmental context that has a broad impact on people’s lives is employment. Although reviews of prior research provide evidence that various workplace factors are associated with substance misuse and SUDs (Ames & Moore, 2016; Frone, 2013, 2019), systematic research on the role workplaces may play in promoting or undermining the SUD recovery process is limited.

Given the importance of facilitating sustainable recovery among individuals with SUDs and the broad significance of employment in people’s lives, this article’s general goal is to present an initial overview of SUD recovery and how the workplace may broadly affect, either positively or negatively, employee recovery from SUDs. The complex nature of SUDs and recovery may not be understood fully by employees, unions, employers, and many.
