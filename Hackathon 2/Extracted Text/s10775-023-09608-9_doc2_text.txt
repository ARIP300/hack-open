the creation of proactive strategies to face life roles and challenges (Lo Presti et al., 2019). Conversely, applying career development theories to the contexts of career challenges, such as unemployment, is a rising research line (Cheng et al., 2020). The existing literature states that some employability dimensions (e.g., career identity, adaptability, and social and human capital) are predictors of job search and job re-entry (Koen et al., 2013). Therefore, studying and measuring employability resources among unemployed persons may elucidate the phenomenon to inform psychological, social, and political interventions.

# The assessment of employability

There are several psychometric measures assessing employability in a unidimensional and multidimensional approach. An example of a unidimensional measure is the Employability Orientation Scale (EOS), created by Van Dam (2004) to assess the attitudes of employees toward developing their employability in their organizations. The EOS distinguishes the antecedents and consequences of employability orientation (i.e., employees’ attitudes toward developing their employability for the organization) without considering the multidimensionality of employability acknowledged in the literature.

The multidimensional measures of employability assess different types of personal features, such as beliefs, competences, and resources. The most popular measure assessing beliefs is the Self-Perceived Employability Scale (SPES), which distinguishes internal beliefs (e.g., beliefs regarding internal attributes) and external beliefs (e.g., beliefs regarding the labor market) in employees (Rothwell & Arnold, 2007), students (Rothwell et al., 2008), and postgraduate students (Rothwell et al., 2009). The SPES is globally recognized, including in Portugal (Gamboa et al., 2022), and inspired the development of other measures, such as the Perceived Future Employability Scale (PFES; Gunawan et al., 2018). The PFES measures participants’ perceptions of their skills, experience, networks, personal traits, knowledge of the labor market, and reputation of one’s educational institution (Gunawan et al., 2018). Conversely, the Career and Employability Beliefs Inventory (CEBI; Barros, 2020) was created in Portugal to assess effort/accomplishment, proactivity/initiative, flexibility/openness to change, acceptance of challenges/risks, optimism and autonomy.

The measures assessing employability as a competence often conceives employability as a set of individual differences, skills, abilities, and psychological variables that favor job search and maintenance. An example of this kind of approach is the Employment Readiness Scale (ERS; Ward & Riddle, 2003), which measures one’s capability to get and keep an appropriate job as well as to manage transitions to new jobs as needed. However, the most popular measure is the Dispositional Measure of Employability, created by Fugate and Kinicki (2008) to assess work and career resilience, openness to changes at work, proactivity at work and in the career, career motivation, and work identity. Subsequently, several other measures were created to assess different types of competencies. For instance, the Employability Attributes Scale measures professional self-management, cultural
