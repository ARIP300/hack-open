in social society participation and an increase in personal vio-

lence. Many enterprises in Malaysia are providing unpaid leave, reducing the workforce’s size, cutting wages, or even closing down due to the economic costs of COVID-19 (Shanmugam et al., 2020). For instance, Genting Malaysia has cut 15% of its workforce (Ngui & Chew, 2020). Social Security Organizations and Employment Insurance System reported that the job losses have increased by 42% in Malaysia, in the first quarter of 2020 (Bernama, 2020b). Consequently, the unemployment rate rose to 5.3% in May 2020, and was expected to rise to 8% by the end of 2020 (Murugiah, 2020). Department of Statistics Malaysia (2020b) pointed out that 52.5% of Malaysians were financial-

ly affected during the MCO, and the Central Bank of Malaysia estimated roughly 951,000 people would face unemployment (Khalid, 2020). The loss of income and anxiety of uncertainty led to a more aggressive character for those pre-existing ag-

gressors. As a result, as at 26 March 2020, the number of domestic violence cases spiked with call-ins increased by 57% or 1893 calls from women in distress, via Talian Kasih (Caring Hotline) in Malaysia (Arumugam, 2020; Hassandarvish, 2020). From 18 March to 30 April 2020, 526 investigation papers were opened in connection with do-

mestic violence in Malaysia (Baharin, 2020). During the lock-

downs, there is limited access to and assistance from the sup-

port structures for domestic violence victims. The majority of

women are forced to stay at home with their aggressors for

longer than usual due to these factors: travel restrictions,

working from home, and kids learning from home.

In short, the COVID-19 pandemic led to health-related

anxieties which could open up possibilities of suicides. The

implementation of social distancing and lockdowns has pro-

duced adverse psychological outcomes. Self-quarantined per-

sons had experienced PTSD, feelings of anxieties or depres-

sion. Due to the massive volume of chores in the workplace,

many frontline workers experience burnout and they are in a

state of depression. The students feel stressed and anxious;

they have to cope with the uncertainties and challenges of

new teaching mode - from classroom to online.

# Volunteering and Mental Wellbeing Benefits

Amid the anxiety, stress, and fear, it seems the COVID-19

might have engendered changes in the people’s attitudes to-

wards volunteering. Trautwein et al. (2020) conducted a study

on volunteering during the lockdown using an online survey

of 565 COVID-19 volunteers in Switzerland from 6

May 2020 to 3 June 2020. The study reveals that the fulfil-

ment of the self-enhancement motive and value motive posi-

tively affected the volunteers’ satisfaction. There have been

several studies done showing that volunteering is not just

about giving, but also gaining mental wellbeing benefits; in-

creased life satisfaction through established social ties;

counteracting negative emotions; and reducing anxieties

(Thoits & Hewitt, 2001; Tierney & Mahtani, 2020;

Veerasamy et al., 2013; Wilson, 2012). With the social dis-

tancing measures, volunteers’ roles have extended to runner

services such as medicine delivery and buying groceries for

the most vulnerable, with the panic buying chaos going on

(Etkind et al., 2020). In Malaysia, the MoH indicated that

more than 1000 retired nurses and 2300 volunteers had joined

the frontline workers during COVID-19 (Zainul, 2020).

Volunteer tailors and non-governmental organizations

(NGOs) around Malaysia helped produce personal protective

equipment for the frontline workers (Shah et al., 2020).

Besides, the civil society campaign - #kitaJagakita (We care

for each other) was started by a group of Malaysian volunteers

to support society by matching people who want to help with

people who need the help (Teoh, 2020).

The positive emotions from volunteering can reduce the

negative emotions such as fear or anxiety due to the pandemic

(Tierney & Mahtani, 2020). Volunteering offers a chance for

people to support and contribute to the society in the pandemic

period. Helping others during their difficulties can increase a

person’s self-confidence and give a sense of identity of pride.

In a nutshell, the COVID-19 pandemic leads to reflection and

rethinking of what volunteers and social purpose organiza-

tions can do for the society, hence, creating a volunteering

society. The next section discusses the PEST analysis.

# PEST Analysis

To provide insights into practitioners, the PEST analysis is

presented in Table 1 below, with the lessons learned from

Malaysia’s experience while combating the COVID-19 pan-

demic. Based on the experience, recommendations are pro-

posed for each aspect as well. For political factors, there is a

full lockdown during the initial stage of the COVID-19 out-

break, imposition of heavy fines and strict enforcement of

laws, and running elections during the Covid-19 pandemic.

Meanwhile, for economic factors, the analysis looks into the

surge of the unemployment rate and residents’ financial bur-

den. In terms of social factors, mental health issues cropped up

and the number of domestic violence cases spiked dur-

ing the pandemic period, which are discussed in the

table. Lastly, the analysis covers technological factors

such as online learning and introducing the mobile ap-

plication for COVID-19 purposes.

# Final Thoughts

As a concluding remark, at the point of writing this paper,

Malaysia has experienced some degrees of success and failure

in the national effort of fighting the COVID-19 pandemic. By
