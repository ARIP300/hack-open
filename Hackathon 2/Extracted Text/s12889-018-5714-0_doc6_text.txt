phone calls with the RCs were documented in a logbook for each center.

Before intervention, focus group interviews were conducted with GPs, RCs and PHCC managers at the intervention centers (n=11). Key questions were about the prevalence of patients with stress-related disorder at the center, and about the tools and procedures when treating and rehabilitating these patients back to work. The GPs’ and RCs’ readiness for change [47, 48] was assessed directly after training.

After intervention, focus group interviews with GPs, RCs and PHCC managers were conducted at 19 out of the 22 participating centers. Participants in the intervention group were asked about how they had organized the implementation, how the intervention had been received among GPs, RCs, and other staff members, and about facilitating and hindering factors for employer involvement in the primary care setting. Participants in the control group were asked similar questions, but with a focus on patient recruitment. In all, 30 interviews were tape recorded and transcribed verbatim.

Together, these data will be used to evaluate the process at the participant centers, and deepen the knowledge about what primary health care needs to involve the employer in the rehabilitation of patients with stress-related disorders.

# Discussion

Given that patients with stress related disorders constitute the largest and fastest increasing group in the sick-leave statistics in Sweden, there is an urgent need to come up with methods to stop this development. Most of these patients get their sickness certificate issued by a GP in the primary health care system. Although current evidence of how to enhance RTW for CMD patients, including stress-related disorders, is yet inconclusive, many recent reviews point to that employer involvement early on in the process might be an efficient way to reduce sick-leave. However, time constraints and uncertainties about the relationships between work and stress hinder many GPs to involve the employer. RCs have been introduced into Swedish primary health care to support the patient in the RTW process through coordination between different stakeholders. This opens a window of opportunity to develop new procedures and tools. This RCT was designed to contribute to knowledge about how procedures of cooperation between GPs and RCs can be organized to facilitate employer involvement and reduce time to RTW among patients suffering from work related stress. Despite considerable efforts to encourage and support GPs and RCs at the participating centers, it turned out to be difficult to recruit patients. Unless the impact of the intervention on RTW is substantial, it will be difficult to detect a difference in RTW between the intervention and control group with the current sample size (n= 132).

One reason why earlier studies within this field points to contradictory results [11, 49] might be that RCT studies commonly strive to reduce the variation between study participants and their contextual environment, instead of using these differences to explain how and why the intervention can have different effects on different groups of people. In the current study we instead assumed that implementation would depend on contextual factors at the organizational level, for example on the pre-existing routines, level of corporation and the total workload among GPs and RCs at each center. We also assumed that the impact of the intervention would depend on for example symptom severity and motivation to RTW among patients. The project design was based on these assumptions; numerous centers were recruited, matched and randomized, and patients in the intervention group were asked to reply to several questions at repeated occasions. However, the evaluation of how contextual and individual level factors effect RTW will also be constrained by the small sample size.

Preliminary analyses of the qualitative interviews conducted before and after intervention point to a set of organizational preconditions which need to be in place for GPs and RCs to be able to engage in a successful corporation. The strength of this study will be that the multitude of organizational level data can shed light upon facilitating and hindering factors for employer involvement in the primary care setting. There are many lessons to be learned about how primary care can face the challenging task of employer involvement: What motivates GPs to corporate with RCs? What do RCs need from their organizations to guide patients with stress-related disorders back to work? How can PHCCs ensure routines for sickness certification that enhance RTW? Such knowledge will be valuable for clinicians and policymakers in their future efforts to organize primary health care for improved RTW rates among patients with stress-related disorders. Results from the study will be communicated to the participating centers and other relevant stakeholders, and disseminated through scientific publication.
