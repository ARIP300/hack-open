code of conduct signals compliance with GDPR as a quality feature of their product, service or business to the consumer and/or business customer. Certificates and codes of conduct thus enable both the controller and the processor to reduce their legal uncertainty and to signal their GDPR conformity on the market. Both mechanisms, i.e. higher legal certainty and GDPR compliance as a quality feature, can be used as a competitive advantage for companies (von Grafenstein 2020). Naturally the auditing, which enterprises must accomplish in the context of a certification or a code of conduct, must not be disproportionate in itself. Therefore the GDPR makes explicitly clear that these auditing processes must take the needs of small and medium-sized companies into account (Art. 40 para. 1 a. E. and Art. 42 para. 1 sentence 2 GDPR). Also in this regard, the risk-based approach can play an important role, for example with regard to the depth of such an auditing (von Grafenstein 2020; Kamara 2017). Also, chambers of commerce and business associations play an outstanding role here. The reason for this is that they are mandated to coordinate and represent the interests of their members. Thus, to support their members setting up certificates and, even more so, codes of conduct to meet the society’s expectations of them, as well as to exploit competitive advantage, fits well in their mandate.

# 2.3 Business Associations as Interfaces Between Controllers, IT Providers and Customers: Coordinating the Implementation of Data Protection by Design

Such a coordinating function, for example of business associations, is particularly necessary if several companies must cooperate to implement the GDPR (See Art. 25 GDPR). An important example in this regard are the requirements of data protection by design and security of processing. These provisions require the controller and partially the processor to implement the requirements of the GDPR into the technical and organizational design of their data processing. In most cases, however, the controller uses the technical solutions of third-party providers for its processing activities. These providers are not obliged or to a lesser extent to comply with the GDPR. This leads to the complex situation in which a data controller is primarily legally responsible, but can only fulfil its responsibility with the help of its IT provider. A prominent example for this situation is the Berlin-based property company Deutsche Wohnen that was recently fined 14.5 million euros by the Berlin data protection authority, particularly because they did not implement a data deletion concept on their servers. However, such a deletion concept was probably only possible for Deutsche Wohnen by using their third-party provider for their servers (Berlin Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information 2019). The interplay between the two actors does not seem to have worked sufficiently.

Interestingly, IT providers can use this situation as a competitive advantage or business opportunity. The reason for this is that the main responsible controller must examine carefully which IT provider supports the controller’s activities best regarding the technical compliance of the GDPR. With legal questions, such as whether a technology corresponds to the state of the art, also here a certificate or code of conduct can act as an important element between the required and actual state (von Grafenstein 2020). With regard to its focus on the interconnection of business and internet technology, Business Informatics can pave the way for research into the development of such technical-organizational solutions and their effects on economic processes.

# 2.4 Three Strategies from the Point of View of the Company: From Avoidance and Prevention to Business Opportunity

Following this understanding, both controllers and processors have three basic approaches for dealing with the GDPR in day-to-day business. The first strategy can be described with the expression “burying the head in the sand”. Deutsche Wohnen probably applied this approach after the Berlin data protection authority had already pointed out the missing deletion concept during an on-site audit in 2017. The second approach follows the classic compliance logic: A data controller or processor only fulfills the GDPR requirements to the extent that it needs proof to defend itself against a “first-time fine” and immediately implements all additional measures if the competent data protection authority demands them. This approach has the advantage of initially low costs, but carries the risk of a competitive disadvantage if a competitor chooses the third strategy. This third strategy makes a virtue out of a necessity: A data controller or processor uses the leeway that the GDPR gives them to proactively find the best solution for their specific data processing. These controllers and processors see GDPR-compliance as a quality feature for their business customers or end users and generate a competitive advantage from it. This approach requires, however, businesses people – either working in academia or in practice – to see the GDPR not from a classical compliance perspective that hinders innovation but as an aspect in their entrepreneurial environment that they can use as a business opportunity.
