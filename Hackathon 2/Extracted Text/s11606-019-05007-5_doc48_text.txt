# BACKGROUND:

Patient engagement among complex high-need patients in intensive primary care programs can be challenging, as many patients experience medical, social, and behavioral barriers to active participation in their care. The Veterans Health Administration (VA) has implemented and tested intensive primary care programs called PACT Intensive Management (PIM). Our goal was to describe barriers and facilitators to engaging high-risk patients by conducting a qualitative analysis of VA PIM staff members' interviews.

# METHODS:

Semi-structured interviews with VA PIM staff members and program leaders regarding their experiences with and reflections on PIM. Interviews were recorded, transcribed, and analyzed to identify patient engagement barriers and facilitators. Twenty-nine interdisciplinary staff members who care for complex high-need patients, including physicians, nurses, psychologists, and social workers.

# RESULTS:

Participants described two main types of barriers and facilitators: those related to patient characteristics and those related to provider/system level characteristics. Patient-level characteristics that facilitated engagement in PIM and their healthcare included: having a pre-existing motivation to improve one's health, having certain chronic conditions and already adhering to a regimen, being a "frequent flier" (e.g., multiple visits per week), being lonely and welcoming human contact, having a desire for extra assistance and interaction, and having been a prior recipient of home-based primary care services and being habituated to healthcare staff entering homes. Provider/system or other-level characteristic-related engagement facilitators included providers making home visits and assessing a patient's home environment, providers having successfully established relationships with patient, patient's family members, connecting patients with other programs and services (e.g., VA or non-VA), having mental health services offered in the primary care clinic (e.g., assisting patients to avoid stigma).

Patient-level characteristics that posed a barrier to engagement included: an active substance use disorder, mental health conditions (e.g., depression, anxiety), and non-adherence to recommended treatment regimens. Provider/system or other-level characteristic-related engagement barriers included the time intensive nature of the PIM work, providers changing (e.g., rotating residents), provider compassion/empathy fatigue and/or not understanding psycho-social issues, and obstruction of care by the patient's caregiver.

# CONCLUSIONS:

Staff in intensive primary care programs identified numerous patient- and provider/system-level factors that influence the engagement of complex, high-need patients and may serve as targets for focused interventions. Increased awareness of barriers and facilitators to patient engagement among high-risk patients may inform intervention design for intensive primary care programs and other services for high-need patients.

# BACKGROUND:

Medical provider burnout is now recognized as an increasingly prominent problem threatening the integrity of the medical profession. Compared to other professions, physicians are 36% more likely to experience symptoms of burnout, with high rates of burnout in primary care providers. Burnout can negatively impact many factors such as productivity, patient trust, and provider mental health. While providers have many possible sources of burnout, the unique milieu of stressors in each clinic environment must be assessed to ensure key contributors are attended to. In our study, we analyzed free text survey responses in order to best identify challenges to provider wellness at an urban academic continuity practice.

# METHODS:

Based on the American Medical Association's STEPS Forward program, our Division of General Internal Medicine formed a faculty wellness committee, which created an anonymous survey with quantitative and qualitative components. The aim of the qualitative survey was to assess providers' major barriers to wellbeing and suggestions for improvement. In this study, the qualitative responses were analyzed using a grounded theory approach. The first reviewer used inductive and deductive strategies to encode statements and then generate overall categories for barriers to well-being. A second reviewer independently assigned survey responses to the categories generated by the first reviewer to determine inter-reviewer reliability. Discrepancies were resolved via discussion between the reviewers and the PI.

# RESULTS:

The inter-rater reliability was 49%. The most often cited factors contributing to provider burnout in order of frequency were lack of teamwork and communication, poor work flow, insufficient staffing, malfunctioning equipment, limited work space, and staff not functioning at the top of their licenses. Examples highlighting limited space, low staff functioning, and equipment malfunction include: "Space cramped, difficult to find space to informally gather as team", "I am often doing things outside.
