projects is obvious and positive. Nevertheless, strategies and measures responding to environmental issues are very limited, and the effort at the government level only is far from enough14. Dudney, Willing15 also suggested that climate change can lead to specific susceptibilities to various diseases, this is even worse for hospital workers who are already overloaded. However, the fact is that hospital workers habitually neglect the importance of their PEB and are not willing to take related actions such as reducing the use of disposable gloves and selecting local medical devices, which exacerbates the deterioration of the environment and causes more severe health problems16. Hence, finding an effective approach to promote hospital workers’ PEB has been commenced by more and more scholars.

For hospital workers, their PEB during medical practices is various, for instance, the disposal of pharmaceutical waste17, the management of electronic waste18, and the pretreatment of medical wastes19. Additionally, environmental protection is directly related to human physical and mental health by reducing pollution, protecting natural resources, maintaining ecological balance, and adopting climate change prevention and control measures20. The improvement of overall health can in turn reduce the workload of hospital workers, and increase their job satisfaction and happiness21. In this respect, the study of PEB at hospital is important because it does not only concern hospital workers’ PEB but also makes huge contributions to their satisfaction and human health. This raises the question-what are influencing factors of their PEB and how to enhance actual PEB? PEB is defined as a kind of behavior selected carefully by individuals that minimizes the adverse effect of human behavior on the environment and improves environmental quality as much as possible22. Numerous studies applied different theories suggest that PEB is affected by many factors, such as gender23, environmental attitude and intention24, and environmental knowledge25. These studies try to clarify some influencing factors of PEB in the household or other workplaces, however, hospital workers’ health risk perception of climate change and the potential mechanisms between their CHRP and PEB have not been elucidated thoroughly. To plug the research gap, we develop the conceptual framework and explore the relationship between hospital workers’ CHRP and their PEB based on the theory of planned behavior (TPB)24, the theory of attitude-behavior-context (ABC)26, and the theory of information-attitude-behavior (IAB)27.

In addition, considering the particularity of hospital workers, the mediating role of their PEA and PEI are examined to further explain the relationship between CHRP and PEB. The rationality of selecting hospital workers’ PEA and PEI as mediating factors is that, compared with other occupations, workers at hospital are more autonomous in their decision-making progress due to their expert knowledge and power, which makes PEB especially arduous at hospital28. In addition, PEB is recognized as an influential factor in terms of workers’ well-being that is a positive emotional state characterized by satisfaction, joy, and overall positivity29. Attitude and intention, likewise well-being, are subjective judgments and individualized experiences30. Although the reality is that the hospital exerts obvious adverse effects on the environment through energy consumption, transportation, and product disposal in the process of preventing, treating, and healing diseases, their workers usually ignore these and regard environmental protection as others responsibility31. To change their subjective attitude and intention about environmental issues is necessary for adopting PEB. Therefore, it is important to examine how the PEA and PEI of hospital workers affect the relationship between their CHRP and their PEB.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In “Theoretical background and hypotheses” section reviews related literature and proposes research hypotheses. In “Research design” section describes specific research methods. In “Data analysis and hypothesis testing” section is research results. Discussion and conclusions are presented in “Discussion” section and “Conclusion” section.

# Theoretical background and hypotheses

# Pro-environmental behavior

Pro-environmental behavior (PEB) refers to a series of behaviors that are related to obtaining materials and energy from the environment and altering the structure of ecosystems in an environmentally friendly way32. The domain of PEB comprises recycling including reusing paper, plastic, and containers, saving resources including energy and water, using public transportation, and properly disposing non-recyclable waste33. At hospital, PEB is somewhat different such as using less disposable gloves and using less packaging23. In addition, using local products rather than imported one is important for environmental protection, because it can relieve the serious pollution resulting from long-distance transport through ships, trucks, and aircrafts34. However, aforementioned PEB cannot be widely adopted by hospital workers35. The willingness to adopt PEB is mainly affected by the mixture of self-interest motives and pro-social motives36. When individuals’ self-interest motives including economic interests, career development, health, and well-being are positively related to their PEB, more PEB may be adopted to maximize their own interests concerning economics and health37. For pro-social motives, generally occur when individuals are willing to help others and prevent risks that may threaten human health38. Additionally, PEB is also influenced by socio-demographic factors such as gender, length of employment, and employment department.

# Climate change health risk perception and pro-environmental behavior

Risk perception is a subjective judgment about hazardous events and can explain how risk is perceived and how much adverse effect is caused39. Risk perception is extremely extensive and complex, it can be quantified and predicted by various factors not only psychological elements including people’s beliefs, attitudes, judgments, and feelings, but also risk communications about how to prevent and deal with them40. The environment provides abundant resources to support human survival and development, hence, human health may be threatened tremendously when the natural environment is destroyed41. Climate change, as a global environmental issue, has been deemed as the biggest human health threat in the twenty-first century42. The disease deriving from environmental risk factors such as air pollution and water pollution is ever-growing, specifically, heat-related.
