family event, such as a daughter's wed-

ding. This goal serves as an immediate priority. However, once this short-term goal is achieved, their focus often shifts to longer-term objectives. This evolu-

tion in perspective is a natural and essential part of the patient's journey. It is a patient's right, as with all individuals, to reassess and modify their priorities over time. As clinicians, it is crucial to acknowledge these dynamics and support them. We should encourage open dialogue, inviting patients to continu-

ously redefine what is most important to them at various stages of their treatment journey. Such a patient-centered ap-

proach ensures that we align treatment strategies with their evolving goals and preferences, thereby enhancing the overall effectiveness and relevance of the care we provide.

Reflecting on the individualized and dynamic nature of patient perspective in CLL treatment, we can see how cru-

cial it is to align clinical objectives with patient-centered outcomes. This leads to another phase of disease control. Therefore, the initial progres-

sion does not always signify the failure of a given therapy, nor does it account for the logistic or symptomatic burden on patients. Recently, there has been an excellent commission in Lancet Hema-

tology that shed light on novel ways of accessing the global burden of treat-

ment and symptoms of patients, both in terms of severity and persistence. For example, a single day of nausea differs significantly from enduring the same symptom persistently for months, yet both scenarios might be categorized as

grade 1 nausea in clinical reports. Therefore, a refined approach to measuring overall symptom burden and incorpo-

rating ways of including the capacity to regain disease control are needed to de-

velop more nuanced efficacy measures that go beyond OS and PFS. In conclu-

sion, we have yet to establish an optimal measure for effectiveness in clinical tri-

als for CLL, which underscores the need for ongoing research and development in this area.
