# EVALUATION

Preliminary data suggests medical students do feel there is a lack of SUDs education in the curricula. However students have a strong interest in learning how to prescribe and utilize buprenorphine in their medical practice. After completing the training, medical students report that they have a better foundation on when buprenorphine can be prescribed and how to recognize SUDs.

# DISCUSSION / REFLECTION / LESSONS LEARNED

Medical students recognize opioid use disorders is an important issue within communities and want to help their future patients. This training has importance to all students regardless of their interested specialty. Offering the MAT training can supplement the school's curricula and is generalizable to use by other medical schools.

# PRIMARY CARE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH INTEGRATION: USE OF A PSYCHOLOGIST IN RESIDENT DIRECT OBSERVATION

# NEEDS AND OBJECTIVES

Structured direct observation is an important component of resident training to ensure achievement of core competencies. For residents who will eventually practice in primary care, mastering these core competencies as they pertain to behavioral health is especially important. Recognizing this need, a growing number of residency programs are incorporating integrated behavioral health clinicians (IBHCs) in clinical training sites. A study of residents in training programs by Hemmings et al. that currently incorporate IBHCs reported an increase in interpersonal communication skills awareness and a positive impact on patient care. We are not aware of existing literature, however, regarding the use of IBHCs in the direct evaluation of residents. As noted in a study of family medicine residents (Martin et al.), though trainees may understand the concepts behind behavioral health competencies, they may not have insight into their own knowledge and skill deficits without direct instructor feedback. IBHCs bring a unique perspective in the assessment of residents in behavioral health-related core competencies. At our institution, we will be using IBHCs in the assessment of residents in structured direct observation. We plan to compare resident core competencies in behavioral health in trainees who experience structured direct observation by both IBHCs and medical attendings compared to trainees exposed to direct observation by only medical attendings.

# SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS

The study setting is a large academic medical center in a densely populated urban area. The study population will be Internal Medicine residents and Combined Internal Medicine-Pediatrics residents at UCLA. Location of the study will be their continuity clinic site. The behavioral health integration at these sites will be provided by doctoral level psychologists (PsyD and PhD).

# DESCRIPTION

This will be a cross-sectional study of Internal Medicine residents in the UCLA- Olive View Primary Care track and Combined Internal Medicine-Pediatrics residents (IHBC + medical attending direct observation) compared to categorical UCLA Internal Medicine residents (medical attending-only direct observation).

# EVALUATION

UCLA has a structured direct resident observation program with a templated evaluation form assessing specific core competencies for each resident. We will compare core competency scores with specific attention to interpersonal communication, professionalism and management of mood disorders between study groups over a 12-month academic year.

# DISCUSSION / REFLECTION / LESSONS LEARNED

We hypothesize that the feedback provided by IBHCs in the structured direct observation of residents will result in improved core competencies with regard to behavioral health. This specific area of core competencies is of special importance as the behavioral health care in our country becomes increasingly fragmented; our primary-care oriented graduates will need to be especially effective and engaged behavioral health advocates for their patients.

# PRIMARY CARE PROFESSIONS PERCEPTIONS: A CURRICULUM TO CORRECT STEREOTYPES AND CLARIFY TEAM ROLES AMONG TRAINEES OF MULTIPLE HEALTH PROFESSIONS

(Control ID #3185610)

# NEEDS AND OBJECTIVES

The Seattle VA Center of Excellence in Primary Care Education (CoEPCE) aims to transform primary care education out of professional silos and train physicians and other health professionals to be highly competent in providing team-based collaborative care. Even with shared CoE educational and clinical training experiences, we find our trainees may still have limited knowledge and misperceptions about skills and roles of their colleagues. Here we describe our curriculum, adapted from Case Western Reserve University's "Interprofessional Exercise," aimed at exploring biases and enhancing understanding of other professions' roles and expertise.

# SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS

Our "Professions Perceptions" seminars are held in primary care once yearly when all participating CoE trainees (n=~35/year) are >3 months into their respective graduate training program. We include all CoE trainees and faculty based in primary care, including internal medicine MDs, nursing (NPs and RNs), psychology, pharmacy, social work, and psychiatry.

# DESCRIPTION

In the seminars, trainees and faculty gather in a conference room with several large posters on the wall. Each poster has the name of one profession with two questions: 1) What are three things you think of when you hear this profession name? and 2) What are this profession's skills and roles on the primary care team? Trainees visit each profession's poster and write their perceptions. Next, trainees and faculty of each profession gather by their profession's poster and review/reflect on the perceptions recorded. Each profession then shares with the large group whether they feel perceptions and roles of their profession were accurately captured; corrects misperceptions; and reviews their team roles.

# EVALUATION

We tracked perceptions poster data for the past two academic years and recorded faculty observations. For some professions, there was near consensus on descriptors: for example, social workers as "magicians" and RNs as "heroes." For other professions, there was a broad range of descriptors and more role confusion; for example, differences and commonalities between MD and NP primary care providers; and psychologists and psychiatrists. Our faculty observe that over time, trainees have increasing sophistication of understanding and appreciation of their interprofessional colleagues.

# DISCUSSION / REFLECTION / LESSONS LEARNED

This curriculum provides a safe, intentional environment for trainees to share their perceptions and confirm or correct perceptions by others. Lessons learned include: 1) timing is crucial to maximize trainee participation and comfort: previous sessions held at orientation were less successful given trainees were still learning about their own professional roles and were less comfortable discussing biases; 2) this seminar builds on CoE trainees' shared training experience to better inform perceptions, and shows increasing knowledge of.
