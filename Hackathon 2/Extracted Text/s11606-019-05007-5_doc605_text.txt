# ABSTRACTS JGIM

# AN ACADEMIC PARTNERSHIP WITH A RURAL TRIBAL JAIL

Matthew Tobey; Rachel E. Simon; Leila H. Borowsky. Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA. (Control ID #3179136)

# STATEMENT OF PROBLEM OR QUESTION (ONE SENTENCE):

Individuals who experience incarceration carry among the most substantial health risks of any group, including excessive rates of substance use disorders, serious mental illness and chronic medical illness. American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) individuals experience the lowest life expectancy of any ethnic or racial group in the United States, just over 70, with large land-based tribes experiencing worse outcomes yet. The Indian Health Service (IHS) provides services to 2.2 million of the nation's 5.2 million AI/AN individuals, including those incarcerated in tribal jails. Little information exists on the health of incarcerated AI/AN individuals, with only five papers in the peer-reviewed literature.

# OBJECTIVES OF PROGRAM/INTERVENTION (NO MORE THAN THREE OBJECTIVES):

- To improve care access for one nation's largest tribal adult correctional facilities
- To provide health education to individuals incarcerated at the tribal jail

# DESCRIPTION OF PROGRAM/INTERVENTION, INCLUDING ORGANIZATIONAL CONTEXT (E.G. INPATIENT VS. OUTPATIENT, PRACTICE OR COMMUNITY CHARACTERISTICS):

Through a clinical services contract with a rural IHS facility, rotating internists from our academic health center team provide year-round clinical care with the IHS in a rural tribal community. Two programs link this program to the local tribal jail: 1. A once-weekly internal medicine clinic in the jail. 2. A student-led health promotion program at the jail in which a team comprised of a mix of PA, NP and MD students teach one-hour health educational sessions to the jail's women's unit followed by the men's unit.

# MEASURES OF SUCCESS (DISCUSS QUALITATIVE AND/OR QUANTITATIVE METRICS WHICH WILL BE USED TO EVALUATE PROGRAM/INTERVENTION):

Measures – clinical program: 1. Stability of the clinic 2. Number of weekly visits 3. Satisfaction of IHS and tribal jail stakeholders 4. Chronic disease outcomes 5. Transitional care post-release from jail. Measures – education program: 1. Sustainability of program and participation of trainees 2. Attendance of individuals who are incarcerated at the jail 3. Satisfaction of participants with the sessions.

# FINDINGS TO DATE (IT IS NOT SUFFICIENT TO STATE FINDINGS WILL BE DISCUSSED):

Both the clinical and educational programs have proven sustainable over two years. 16 patients are seen during the weekly half-day morning clinic. High levels of satisfaction have been expressed by IHS and tribal jail leadership with the clinic. The tribal jail has repeatedly requested additional weekly clinic sessions. Successful care navigation has led to placements at the tribal alcohol inpatient program, the tribal methamphetamine inpatient program, and our team's hepatitis C initiative at the IHS. The health promotion curriculum has become the jail's primary health programming for its population. All 60 trainees over the past 18 months have participated. Students often list participation in the sessions as a highlight of the rotation. Intermittent surveys of jail participants have shown high satisfaction and been used to elicit topics for future weeks. 10 women and 15 men participate on a typical week.

# KEY LESSONS FOR DISSEMINATION (WHAT CAN OTHERS TAKE AWAY FOR IMPLEMENTATION TO THEIR PRACTICE OR COMMUNITY?):

Tribal jails represent an opportunity for the pursuit of health equity and public health agendas. Clinical and non-clinical activities in tribal jails, as described, may strengthen connections between Native health systems and correctional facilities.

# STATEMENT OF PROBLEM OR QUESTION (ONE SENTENCE):

How do we provide effective, dignified primary care for medically complex patients with homelessness in a safety-net health system?

# OBJECTIVES OF PROGRAM/INTERVENTION (NO MORE THAN THREE OBJECTIVES):

- To effectively engage homeless patients with complex barriers to primary care
- To provide dignified, trauma-informed care focused on patient-oriented care goals while addressing addiction, mental health, and chronic disease
- To implement an interdisciplinary care team model in a safety-net health care system combining primary care, social work, care coordination, and nursing
