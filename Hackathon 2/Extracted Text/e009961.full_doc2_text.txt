discrimination, the items used were ‘Because of how experienced workplace discrimination were dichotomised into ‘No’ (‘not at all’) and ‘Yes’ (‘a little’, ‘moderately’, ‘a lot’). For the third research question, multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed, using work status as the dependent variable (defined as 0=no paid employment and 1=employed), and 10 independent variables, including experienced workplace discrimination. First, univariate analyses were conducted including the following independent variables that were expected to be related to job outcome: experienced workplace discrimination, gender, age, ethnicity (ie, belonging to an ethnic minority), level of education, marital status, previous psychiatric treatment, age of first contact with mental health services, internalised stigma (ISMI total score) and HDI. Second, all variables that showed a significant relationship with the dependent variable on a univariate level (p<0.05) were included in the multivariable logistic regression analysis.

For the second research question, consistent with the methodology of a previous ASPEN/INDIGO paper, countries were divided into groups according to the Human Development Index (HDI). The HDI is a summary measure of human development established by the United Nations, which measures the average achievements of a country in three basic dimensions of human development: (1) long and healthy life (operationalised as life expectancy at birth), (2) access to knowledge, (ie, the mean number of years of schooling) and (3) standard of living, (ie, gross national income per capita). Since data were gathered in 2010, the HDI statistic of that year was used. Countries with a very high HDI score were England, Australia, Finland, Germany, Canada, Italy, Portugal, Belgium, France, Japan, Greece, the Netherlands, Scotland, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, the Czech Republic, Taiwan and Hungary. Countries with a high HDI score were Turkey, Malaysia, Brazil, Serbia, Bulgaria, Venezuela, Tunisia, Lithuania, Romania and Croatia. Since few countries had a low HDI, the medium low and low HDI group were taken together as one group for the analyses. This medium/low HDI group included Egypt, India, Morocco, Nigeria, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.

# RESULTS

A total of 834 people with MDD across 35 different countries were individually interviewed for this study. About half of all participants were married or cohabiting, and two-thirds of the participants were women. Characteristics of the sample are shown in table 1. Although there were differences in employment rate across sites, the employment rates per HDI group did not differ significantly.

As shown in table 2, for each separate question, about 40–50% of the participants indicated that discrimination was not a problem for them. However, when looking at the four items combined, about two-thirds (62.5%) of the total sample reported anticipated and/or experienced discrimination in the work setting due to their mental health problem. Almost one-third of participants indicated to have stopped themselves from applying for work because of anticipated discrimination.

Regarding the second research question, significant differences were found between the groups with different HDI levels. Specifically, participants in countries with a very high HDI reported significantly more often anticipated (χ2=26.01 (df=2), p<0.01) and also experienced (χ2=7.25 (df=2), p<0.05) discrimination than participants in countries with moderate/low HDI (see figure 1). As can also be seen from figure 1, in all three groups the anticipated workplace discrimination scores were higher than the experienced workplace discrimination scores.

Concerning the third research question, as can be seen in table 3, several variables were not related to work status on a univariate level (ie, ‘belonging to an ethnic minority’, ‘marital status’, ‘age of first contact with mental health services’ and ‘HDI’), for which reason they were not included in the multivariable model. Results from the multilevel logistic regression analysis showed that experienced workplace discrimination was independently and positively related to work status.
