# 6 Epistemic Injustice: An Overlooked Barrier to Vaccine Hesitancy

The issue of stakeholder engagement with public healthcare initiatives such as the Covid-19 vaccine presents a unique and valuable case example to explore the role of power dynamics and the inadequacies of the stakeholder approach. Unbeknown to many, in a stakeholder approach, power imbalances can result in bias in access and participation from the uneven distribution of influence and control in the interactions and processes between public policy makers and a diverse populace. This, in turn, sustains the dominance of specific perspectives and influences over the prioritization of certain issues over others within the policy domain, perpetuating epistemic injustice despite the best of intentions in seeking stakeholder participation.

This calls for the need to pay greater attention to the issues of epistemic injustice within public policy making. The data analysis underscored the significant implications of epistemic injustice as a significant barrier to vaccine hesitancy, which, to date, has lacked any empirical and theoretical contributions. The analysis of Covid-19 vaccination initiative highlighted how epistemic injustice and overlooking power disequilibrium between stakeholders’ engagement can lead to vaccine hesitancy especially among minority groups deprived of adequate access to channels of communication, accurate information, and active stakeholder participation.

In terms of unfair outcome epistemic injustice conditions, the research highlighted the disproportionate impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on ethnic minority communities, particularly those of Black ethnicity. This included increased vulnerability to the virus, the impact of response measures, and various socioeconomic challenges. From an epistemic injustice perspective, this revealed a potential lack of consideration for these communities’ unique experiences and vulnerabilities in formulating Covid-19 response measures.

Regarding unfair judgment about epistemic capacity, the study suggested the underrepresentation and neglect of local knowledge in pandemic response and vaccination planning. While the Joint Committee on Vaccination emphasized evidence-based decision making, more explicit consideration of diverse perspectives was needed and raised questions about the inclusivity of the decision-making process. The situation was also exacerbated by a number of prominent individuals themselves flouting the very regulations they themselves had imposed thereby undermining epistemic confidence in the Covid-19 decision-making process and by extension the subsequent vaccination rollout.

In the context of the unfair denial of stakeholder rights, the study highlighted the centralized decision-making. Consequently, there are several crucial recommendations for various stakeholders, encompassing health practitioners, community groups, health researchers, and science and policy officials. Health practitioners are advised to undergo...
