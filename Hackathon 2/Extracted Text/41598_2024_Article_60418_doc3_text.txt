risk perception of ocean microplastics plays a crucial role in tourists’ intention toward environmental protection. In addition, a study using the artificial intelligence (AI) voice demonstrates that AI can elicit risk perception and then motivate pro-environmental behavioral intention69. As for sustainable consumption behavior, risk perception regarding environmental issues makes significant contributions to the increased behavioral intention through the role of environmental concern70. Another study focusing on environmental pollution shows that when local residents perceive more adverse effects of pollution, they show more intention to take measures such as reducing car use to mitigate pollution71. The hospital is the main force to deal with adverse health effects from climate change, which makes the study focusing on hospital workers’ PEB important72. For hospital workers, several studies have clarified the relationship between their risk perception and intention to protect the environment, which presents a positive correlation67,73,74. Hence, in this study, we can predict that the more health risk perceived by hospital workers, the more positive intention can form toward environmental protection. The following hypothesis is proposed:

# Hypothesis 3

Hospital workers’ climate change health risk perception has a significant positive effect on pro-environmental intention.

# Pro‑environmental attitude

Attitude is a subjective and psychological inclination of an individual toward a specific person, event, or concept, which can affect individuals’ perception, emotion, and behavior75. Pro-environmental attitude (PEA) refers to a strong willingness to adopt PEB to protect the environment and achieve sustainable development, it is relatively stable and comprises three main aspects: cognitive composition, emotional composition, and behavioral tendency composition76. Therefore, attitude, as a critical variable to predict behavior, is incorporated into multiple theories to understand human behavior, such as the TPB (Ajzen, 1991), the IAB27, and the ABC26. Specifically, TPB has become an ideal and powerful instrument to explain and predict behavior in the field of physical activity, consumer behavior, and privacy protection77–81. At present, many instruments have been applied to predict and measure individuals’ attitude, among them, the most widely used is the new ecological paradigm (NEP) proposed by Riley E. Dunlap in 198082. Based on ecological principles, the aim of NEP is to understand individuals’ perception and attitude of environmental issues. The complete questionnaire of NEP contains several facets such as balancing the ecosystem, negating anthropocentrism, restricting the use of natural resources, and reducing the possibility of an eco-crisis83.

In terms of environmental protection, a great number of studies have a special focus on individuals’ attitude towards the environment and draw a conclusion that these attitudes contribute to the adoption of PEB84–86. Generally, the environmental attitude is divided into two facets: attitude towards the overall environment or specific parts such as water and soil, attitude towards pro-environment behavior such as recycling and energy conservation, which can be influenced by multitudinous factors from the level of environment, social, and individual87. However, there is a noteworthy “attitude-behavior” gap, an example is the study focusing on green purchasing, consumers realize the severity of environmental issues and are concerned about these, however, they do not display actual green purchasing behavior88. Redondo and Puelles89 also pointed out a significant attitude-behavior gap in the field of unhealthy diets including fast food, alcoholic beverages, and pre-cooked meals, the lack of self-control is a reasonable cause to explain this gap. In addition, this gap also appears in tourism, tourists are willing to take effective behaviors to protect the environment, however, it has not become an actual PEB90.

Even so, using PEA to explain and predict actual PEB is feasible. Most of current studies regard the TPB as a theoretical basis to explain the relationship between attitude and behavior, it is worth noting that this interaction is indirect, specifically, the attitude plays a direct role in intention, and then contributes to particular behavior24. At hospital, the TPB is also applicable, and Widianto, Kautsar19 found that hospital workers’ PEA can forecast intention related to PEB. However, the ABC and IAB demonstrate a direct link between attitude and behavior, as for hospital workers, whether this direct relationship exists needs more studies to elucidate. In the light of the above discussions, we propose the following hypothesis:

# Hypothesis 4

Hospital workers’ pro-environmental attitude has a significant positive effect on pro-environmental behavior.

# Pro‑environmental intention

Intention, as a direct precursor to behavior, is a predictive psychological state that reflects individuals’ plans and actual behavior. The formation of intention is sophisticated, and individual beliefs, attitudes, social pressure, and self-efficacy can influence this process91. Pro-environmental intention (PEI) is individuals’ willingness to adopt behavior related to environmental protection, it is a collection of intrinsic motivations for taking PEB92. More and more scholars have dedicated to applying the TPB to gain a deep insight of PEB such as the reduction of haze pollution93, the utilization of public transport73, and the classification of waste94. The TPB indicates that the intention is a direct predictor to predict the performance of a specific behavior, and the stronger the intention, the more likely individuals are to execute the behavior24. However, the formation of intention is not simple, Ajzen77 demonstrated that individuals’ attitude, subjective norm, and perceived behavioral control towards environmental issues can affect their intention and eventually promote or impede PEB.

According to the TPB, attitude towards behavior is a remarkable predictor that can explain and promote behavioral intention (Ajzen, 1991). The study of Kalafatis, Pollard95 also clearly determines the appropriateness of using TPB to explain intention. Nowadays, relevant research suggests that PEI is strongly or moderately related to PEB. For example, Widianto, Kautsar19 demonstrated that individuals possessing the intention to sort and recycle wastes adopt more actual PEB such as waste disposal. Shimoda, Hayashi96 suggested that PEI can further promote
