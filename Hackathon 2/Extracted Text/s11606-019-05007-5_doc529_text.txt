# LEARNING OBJECTIVE #1:

Recognize an atypical presentation of Cat Scratch Disease in an elderly patient

# CASE:

A 71 year old woman presented with fever, fatigue, rigors and confusion. Exam was notable for T 102.7F, 94% RA, encephalopathy and bibasilar rales. WBC was 9.8. There was no pulmonary consolidation and initial infectious work up was negative. She was empirically treated for presumed atypical pneumonia; however, she continued to have fevers. She had cats at home that do not scratch or bite. She noted a right forearm pustule that was intermittently purulent and crusted over the past two months. Imaging revealed 10-15 hypodense hepatosplenic lesions and abdominal lymphadenopathy. TTE and TEE were normal. A liver biopsy and punch biopsy of the arm pustule were non-diagnostic. Although initial Bartonella serologies and PCR were negative, given the clinical findings of fever, lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenic involvement and cat exposures at home, the patient was treated for presumptive Bartonellosis. She clinically improved and serial serologies (Bartonella IgG) became positive with a titer of 1:256 at 4 weeks. The hepatosplenic lesions and lymphadenopathy decreased in size after four weeks of azithromycin. The positive convalescent serologies and clinical improvement with antibiotics confirmed the diagnosis of Cat Scratch Disease.

# IMPACT/DISCUSSION:

Cat Scratch Disease commonly presents in children with self-limited regional lymphadenopathy. Elderly patients are more likely to present atypically with endocarditis, encephalitis, and fever of unknown origin. Due to a lower suspicion for Cat Scratch Disease in older patients, the diagnosis is often delayed. A diagnosis is usually made clinically with a history of cat exposure. Serological testing may be performed, however it has poor sensitivity and specificity. IgG titers 1:256 or more suggests active or recent infection. Biopsies are not routinely performed for diagnosis, but the Warthin-Starry stain may reveal B. henselae bacilli. In this case, the patient is an elderly woman with vague symptoms and found to have lymphadenopathy and hepatosplenic lesions. Despite negative serology and biopsy stains, her clinical presentation was consistent with Cat Scratch Disease, and she was empirically treated with antibiotics. The improvement in hepatosplenic lesions and the positive convalescent serologies confirmed the diagnosis of Bartonellosis. Negative serology does not exclude the diagnosis and patients should be treated if there is clinical suspicion. Cat Scratch Disease should be considered in patients with unexplained fevers with known cat exposure, even without a history of scratches or bites. Transmission of Cat Scratch Disease has been observed in individuals with cats with fleas and in younger cats.

# CONCLUSION:

Elderly patients often present atypically with more generalized and systemic symptoms, but Cat Scratch Disease should be considered if the patient's history includes exposures to cats at home, regardless of history of bites or lack thereof.

# SECONDARY ADRENAL INSUFFICIENCY UNMASKED BY INFECTIOUS DIARRHEA

Andrea Pagan; Denise Feradov. University of South Florida, Tampa, FL. (Control ID #3186554)

# LEARNING OBJECTIVE #1:

Clinicians should consider adrenal insufficiency in all acutely ill patients presenting with undifferentiated shock.

# LEARNING OBJECTIVE #2:

Adequate treatment of adrenal crisis using stress-dose intravenous steroids shouldn't be delayed for confirmatory testing.

# CASE:

A 22-year-old African American male with no past medical history presented to the ED with altered mental status, fever and diarrhea for one day. On physical examination he was febrile, hypotensive, tachycardic and oriented by only to person. Initial workup revealed leukocytosis with a left shift, normal BMP, elevated lactic acid of 2.50 mmoll/L, and elevated procalcitonin of 2.23 ng/mL. Imaging including CXR and CT abdomen with oral contrast were unremarkable. CSF, blood and urine cultures were sterile. Stool GI pathogen panel was positive for Enteroaggregative Escherichia coli. The patient's symptoms improved after antibiotics were started. However, he continued to have episodes of hypotension requiring fluid boluses. Upon further interviewing, the patient reported weight loss, fatigue, and weakness for two years prior to his current presentation. A random cortisol and ACTH stimulation test were ordered, and the results were consistent with secondary adrenal insufficiency. Stress dose steroids were started followed by a taper. MRI of the brain with contrast showed an atrophic pituitary gland without masses. His symptoms improved, and he was discharged on daily hydrocortisone. On outpatient follow-up, repeated testing confirmed the diagnosis of secondary adrenal insufficiency with suppressed ACTH and cortisol levels. The rest of the pituitary workup was normal.

# IMPACT/DISCUSSION:

Approximately 6,000,000 people in the United States are believed to have undiagnosed adrenal insufficiency, which becomes clinically significant only during times of physiologic stress, as in our patient. Chronic exogenous steroid use is the most common cause of hypothalamic-pituitary axis suppression that can result in adrenal insufficiency, although hypopituitarism should also be considered. Secondary adrenal failure is easily missed, since many of the classical symptoms of Addison's disease are absent. Clinicians should be aware that the major impact of a stressor in a patient with corticosteroid insufficiency is on the systemic inflammatory and immune response. When the body is unable to modulate this reaction, it creates the exaggerated response observed in this case and mimics shock. This information is important since patients with undiagnosed and diagnosed adrenal insufficiency and are experiencing an active adrenal crisis episode have a dismal prognosis if left untreated.

# CONCLUSION:

Secondary adrenal insufficiency occurs because of a disruption in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, causing a myriad of non-specific symptoms. The hallmark of adrenal crisis is hypotension and shock refractory to fluid resuscitation and vasopressors. This one is a life-threatening condition and treatment shouldn't be delayed for confirmatory testing.

# SECONDARY EVAN'S SYNDROME: A RARE PRESENTING MANIFESTATION OF SYSTEMIC LUPUS ERYTHEMATOSUS

# LEARNING OBJECTIVE #1:

To Diagnose Evans Syndrome(ES)

# LEARNING OBJECTIVE #2:

To identify systemic lupus erythematosus(SLE) as a cause of secondary Evans Syndrome

# CASE:

A 24 years old female with previous normal menstrual cycles presented with a history of intermittent spontaneous vaginal bleeding for two months and generalized weakness for six months. No obvious gynecological cause for bleeding was apparent after preliminary workup. A detailed evaluation revealed no history of fever, weight loss, hair loss, oral ulcers, photosensitivity and arthropathic symptoms including morning stiffness. On examination, she had stable vitals, conjunctival pallor with a scleral clot over the right eye and petechial hemorrhages all over the body. Detailed systemic examination was unremarkable. Her routine blood examination detected anemia (Hb-4.3gm/dl), low platelet count (5x103/ Î¼l), normal total leukocyte count and corrected reticulocyte count of 7.4%. Peripheral smear (PS) showed microcytic hypochromic anemia with spherocytes. Bone marrow (BM) aspirate was
