# Table 1 PEST Analysis for COVID-19

|Factors| |Lessons learned from Malaysia’s Experience|Recommendations| |
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Political|Full lockdown during the initial stage of COVID-19 outbreak|As at 29 April 2020, Malaysia achieved a recovery rate of about 69%, which ranked 4th among the ASEAN countries (Kaos, 2020).| | |
| |It is essential to enforce a full lockdown to prevent crowd gathering and slow down the COVID-19 spreading. However, the government must give clear instructions, standard operating procedures and guidelines on the lockdown measures to avoid confusion and panic among the people.| | | |
|Imposition of heavy fines and strict enforcement of laws|Malaysia introduced strict enforcement of roadblocks and handed down penalties to curb unnecessary travel-- a compound fine of RM1000 for breaching MCO-related rules and standard operating procedures (Tanzizi, 2020).| | | |
| |The heavier fines are intended to act as a deterrent and not to add additional burden to individuals who are already severely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. This has serious economic and social ramifications. Greater clarity on the standard operating procedures of dos and don’ts must be communicated to the general public prior to the implementation to avoid confusion.| | | |
|Running election during COVID-19|Malaysia recorded a spike of COVID-19 positive cases since September 2020 due to an election in Sabah state (Geraldine, 2020). Politicians held mass gatherings and the government authority failed to enforce social distancing among voters.| | | |
| |Postponing election is the most responsible action to protect the public health during the COVID-19 pandemic. Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance reported that 68 countries and territories have postponed national or local elections between 21 February 2020 and 26 July 2020.| | | |
|Economic|Surge of unemployment rate|Wage subsidy program 2.0 to support businesses faced with revenue reduction; ensure employees receive reasonable wages and minimize layoffs during the pandemic (The Star, 2020).| | |
| |Providing financial aid is a short-term solution to mitigate the economic impacts of COVID-19. In the long term, the government should provide training or upskill programs for the unemployed. People can master a skill to get a job and not rely on government support all the times.| | | |
| |Residents’ financial burden|Introduced Prihatin Rakyat Economic Stimulus Package (PRIHATIN), National Economic Recovery Package (PENJANA), and KITA PRIHATIN Package (The Star, 2020).| | |
| |The limitations of the economic packages are that they do not include everyone in the society and address a range of different aspects of people’s lives. The economic packages should cover everyone in the society from corporates to individuals. All-day childcare should be provided for free to frontliners’ children. There should be double relief for single parents and child supplements should be provided. For non-profit organizations, the government can introduce a special loan program to help them remain operational during the pandemic. Funds should be allocated for investment in the future such as digital schools or all-day childcare centers.| | | |
|Social|Mental Health Issues|Frontliners started to burn out with job demands, developed psychological fatigue, and eventually led to poor working performance (Nienhaus & Hod, 2020).| | |
| |Confidential mental health and psychosocial support services must be made available to frontline workers. In case of crises, the frontliners should have access to psychotropic medications and mental healthcare facilities. Then, it is significant to encourage peer support or establish a buddy system. This can assist inexperienced frontliners and they can speak to people that understand their conditions. Employers should respect their workers’ rest hours and off days. Employers can also implement “flexi-time” and “flexi-load” of which shifts are shared by a few teammates.| | | |
|Spike in domestic violence cases during the pandemic|From 18 March to 30 April 2020, 526 investigation papers were opened in connection with domestic violence in Malaysia (Baharin, 2020).| | | |
| |The government must provide efficient support to survivors of violence such as shelters, hotline and counselling. The national hotline should be available 24 h to ensure the victims can reach the authorities. There is a need to develop innovative methods for reporting violence. For example, code words on| | | |
