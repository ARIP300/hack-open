# ABSTRACTS

Cough or sputum production was reported. She was visiting from out of town and was inconsistently taking home medications for hypertension, diabetes, and atrial fibrillation. She had been walking more than usual and did not report chest pain but did develop a small toe laceration. Her blood pressure was found to be 210/110 mmHg on arrival and temperature of 101.1F. Elevated JVP, bibasilar crackles, and bilateral lower extremity edema were present. The right great toe had a small superficial laceration without evidence of drainage or surrounding infection. She was treated for decompensated heart failure and suspected sepsis. Broad spectrum antibiotics were initiated. Blood culture reports returned 6 hours after the draw with group B streptococcus. Antibiotics were transitioned to IV ceftriaxone and she was discharged on cefadroxil. No other source of infection was identified, and bacteremia was attributed to the small toe laceration.

# IMPACT/DISCUSSION:

The CDC Active Bacterial Core surveillance estimates that 28,000 cases of invasive GBS occurred in 2014 and 93% occurred in non-pregnant adults. It is emerging as a frequent cause of invasive infection in non-pregnant adults with underlying chronic medical conditions. The main clinical presentations were bacteremias without apparent focus and soft tissue infections. One study reported that osteoarticular, skin and soft tissue infections account for 31% of manifestations and 45% of all patients studied experienced a complicating bacteremia. In about a quarter of the episodes of bacteremia studied, no source of infection identified. The most frequent risk factors associated were chronic kidney disease, cardiac failure, neoplasia history, ischemic heart disease, and diabetes mellitus. The high proportion of episodes of bacteremia indicates that blood cultures should be obtained in any elderly patient presenting with a skin and soft tissue infection or osteoarticular infection. GBS is susceptible to penicillin and amoxicillin, but these medications are only used for treatment about 29% of the time. Microbiology labs do not routinely test for sensitivities to GBS considering its consistent susceptibility to these antibiotics. It is important for internists to recognize the value of antibiotic stewardship and deescalate antimicrobial coverage accordingly when GBS is identified.

# CONCLUSION:

The incidence of invasive GBS infection is rising in the non-pregnant adult population. Penicillin is first line treatment for GBS infection and given the near uniform susceptibility, microbiology labs do not routinely run sensitivity testing on GBS species.

# IS THIS MUNDANE WORK? REFLECTIVE WRITING TO EMOTIONAL WELL BEING.

Manisha Bhide. University of Colorado Denver, Aurora, CO. (Control ID #3167939)

# LEARNING OBJECTIVE #1:

Reflect on daily work.

# LEARNING OBJECTIVE #2:

Realize the importance of networking at regional and national level. Reflective writing and mentoring relationships play an important role in work satisfaction and emotional well being.

# CASE:

Boom! Boom! The shots rang out, about to claim a life, but Ricky survived. "Rosie, why did you save me?" He croaked. "I want to die. I have nothing left to live for. Whatever mattered is all gone". "Ricky, He has given you a chance to lead a human life and you have to make the most of it. Until now you lived for yourself. Now, maybe you can live for the society. There is so much to do. It is ultimately your relationship to Him that really matters." "In my busy clinic, I was running late again! I glanced at the paper in the door. "Paul P- BP followup." "This should be quick. It is just BP follow up. That should allow me to catch up" I thought erroneously. Paul unfolded his handkerchief from pocket and dabbed his eyes and unfolded his life story with it. He belonged to the era that still carried his handkerchief and ironed his jeans. Paul's wife of 40 years, Clara had a stroke. He spent every waking moment in the nursing home with Clara. He took it upon himself to clean her, dress her and take care of her personal hygiene every day for 18 years. She passed away in the middle of the night. I secretly felt relieved for Paul, thinking that his suffering was over. He could lead a new, near normal life. But, that aphasic expression, that contracted numb hand, that incontinent, sacral decubed relationship with Clara meant more to Paul than anything else in this world.

# IMPACT/DISCUSSION:

I met "Dr. Young", my SGIM mentor 10 years ago when I was an eager junior faculty. He encouraged me to participate in National clinical content subcommittee and gave me a letter of recommendation for promotion. He was there with me in the reflective writing workshop. He has played a key role as a mentor and a guide in my professional development. I like the opening greeting that he uses in every mentor-mentee meeting "Are you enjoying what you are doing?" Our residents do a reflective writing as a part of the continuity clinic didactics. These have served as a baseline for peer reviewed publication in JGIM, Annals, JAMA etc. Medical students are doing reflective writing as a part of hidden curriculum and learning professionalism. This helps them share their emotions like about the first death they encountered. Research has shown that this helps mental well being of trainees and professionals and gives them resilience.

# CONCLUSION:

Reflecting on each of these instances, every one of us needs to pour our heart and soul and passionately cherish our daily work like a prayer. Even in this world of electronic medical records, smart phones and virtual lives in social media, it is the human relationships that matter the most. It is through our routine, daily work that we are realizing our relationship with Him every moment of our lives and rising from mundane work to higher spiritual level.

# IT GETS WORSE BEFORE IT GETS BETTER: DELAYED POST HYPOXIC LEUKOENCEPHALOPATHY

Stephen M. Stuart1; Maddie Bender1; Starr Steinhilber2. 1UAB, Birmingham, AL; 2University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL. (Control ID #3185883)

# LEARNING OBJECTIVE #1:

Define the clinical pattern of Diffuse Post-Hypoxic Leukoencephalopathy (DPHL)

# CASE:

A 58-year-old woman presents from a rehab facility for acute change in mental status. During a recent admission she was found down with profound hypoxia due to medication overdose, intubated, and experienced cardiac arrest during the hospitalization. She improved after one week in the intensive care unit and was verbal, mobile, and interactive at the time of discharge to the rehab facility. She then functionally declined within days and on admission to our facility was aphasic and encephalopathic. Exam notable normal vitals, minimal interaction, clonus with upgoing Babinski, diffuse rigidity with flexion of elbows, wrists, and hands, as well as mutism. Work up included a CT Head notable for subacute infarct that had been seen previously. Labs were unremarkable and infectious causes of encephalopathy were unrevealing other than a UA suggestive of UTI for which she was treated without improvement. EEG had generalized slowing with no seizure activity. Brain MRI revealed multiple white matter lesions consistent with demyelination. CSF fluid was normal. Given her imaging suggestive of demyelination, her clinical course of a hypoxic event with initial mental improvement followed by decompensation, exam findings, and otherwise negative work-up, the patient was diagnosed with DPHL. She slowly improved throughout her admission and became more alert, less confused and three months later she was independent on her ADLs with minimal neurologic deficits.

# IMPACT/DISCUSSION:

DPHL is a rare diagnosis that requires both clinical suspicion, specific imaging findings, and appropriate exclusion of other plausible diagnoses (1). The illness script includes a hypoxic insult to the brain followed by a lucid period with subsequent worsening of mentation. Lucid period reported at 2-40 days following recovery from initial hypoxic event (1). Subsequent clinical features include mutism, parkinsonism, bizarre behavior, frontal release signs, pathologic laughing, and hyperelexia. Radiographical findings include demyelination of the cerebral white matter. MRI is the best modality to visualize demyelination of white matter in the brain thought to be specific for DPHL (1). After a thorough work up, our team was without a diagnosis that could explain.
