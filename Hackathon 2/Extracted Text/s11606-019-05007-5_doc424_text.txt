# LEARNING OBJECTIVE #1:

Recognize this congenital anomaly as a potential cause of dysphagia in an otherwise nonspecific presentation.

# CASE:

A 69 year-old man with controlled HIV, COPD and significant smoking history presented to the ED complaining of sore throat and solid-food dysphagia without discrete odynophagia, along with a 30-pound weight loss over 3 months. Physical exam, routine labs, and CXR were unrevealing. Last CD4 count 1 month prior was 964. Given the patient's risk factors and presentation, diagnostics focused around esophageal pathologies. An initial barium swallow demonstrated esophageal dysmotility approximately one-third of the way down the esophagus. No discrete ulcers or strictures were visualized. A subsequent esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) corroborated the existence of a pulsatile vessel along the posterior esophageal wall resulting in mild esophageal compression without significant luminal narrowing. EGD was otherwise unremarkable. A CT chest was obtained to evaluate for extrinsic mass effect which revealed an aberrant right subclavian vessel coursing posterior to the esophagus. A Videofluoroscopic Swallow Study was conducted to further evaluate the degree of esophageal narrowing and functional effect on swallowing, both of which were reported as minimal. A conservative management approach was advised with the patient instructed to chew well, eat slower and utilize smaller bites. Nutritional supplements were also begun. At 1 month follow up the patient reported resolution of symptoms and a 5 pound weight gain was noted.

# IMPACT/DISCUSSION:

An aberrant right subclavian artery, also known as arteria lusoria, is a congenital abnormality of the aortic arch wherein the right subclavian artery originates distal to the left subclavian artery. Arising from the distal aortic arch, the aberrant subclavian typically passes behind the esophagus and back across the midline to perfuse the right arm. General population prevalence is between 0.5-1.8% with 70-80% of patients being asymptomatic. When symptomatic, 91% experience dysphagia; termed dysphagia lusoria. Cough, chest pain, and Horner's syndrome have also been reported. While the exact mechanism of associated dysphagia is unknown, direct esophageal compression and/or motility changes are suspected. Dysphagia lusoria is most often diagnosed via barium swallow study showing a diagonal defect between the third and fourth vertebrae, followed by CT scan and upper endoscopy to help both confirm diagnosis and exclude alternate pathology.

# CONCLUSION:

This case illustrates a rare congenital anomaly that is typically only discovered incidentally, but when symptomatic, most often presents with dysphagia. Recognition of this pathology and screening for extrinsic mass effect is important given the non-specific presentation. Further, endoscopy is generally insensitive and can result in diagnostic delay. If symptoms fail to respond to conservative management, treatment of an aberrant right subclavian artery typically involves correction with vascular surgery.

# LEARNING OBJECTIVE #1:

Identify risk factors for pancreatic fistulas and the basic underlying pathophysiology.

# LEARNING OBJECTIVE #2:

Recognize the general clinical features of pancreatic fistulas.

# CASE:

A 72-year-old female with a history of alcoholic pancreatitis and recent perforated diverticulitis requiring emergent sigmoid colectomy with colostomy presented to urgent care with progressive shortness of breath and associated lower extremity swelling. She was initially afebrile with a blood pressure of 91/51, heart rate of 108, respiratory rate of 20 and oxygen saturation of 91% on room air. She was ill appearing with increased work of breathing, crackles throughout her lung fields and pitting edema up to her shins bilaterally. Chest X-ray showed a moderate right-sided pleural effusion. Lower extremity Doppler ultrasound showed acute proximal deep vein thromboses bilaterally. She was admitted to the ICU and started on a heparin drip for presumed pulmonary embolism. Thoracentesis revealed an exudative effusion with a significantly elevated amylase level. A chest tube was placed for continuous drainage and octreotide was started. ERCP identified a pancreatic-pleural fistula. The patient's pancreatic duct was stented. Her chest tube output gradually decreased and further imaging showed stabilization of the pleural fluid, allowing discontinuation of octreotide and removal of the chest tube. She was ultimately discharged on day 27 of her hospitalization.

# IMPACT/DISCUSSION:

Pancreatic fistulas can develop when the pancreatic duct is disrupted because of pancreatic disease, surgery or trauma, with subsequent leakage of secretions into the adjacent space. The pancreatic duct may communicate with the pleural or peritoneal cavity or other viscera, forming an internal fistula, or with the skin, forming an external fistula. Internal pancreatic fistulas are most commonly associated with chronic alcohol-induced pancreatitis, as in our patient. Pancreatic-pleural fistulas are rare, with an estimated incidence of 0.4%. This case illustrates the potential complexity of an uncommon condition that can present in a routine fashion. The diagnosis can be made based on evidence of pancreatic duct disruption on MRCP/ERCP, with high levels of amylase in the extravasated pancreatic fluid. Management involves supportive care and endoscopic therapy, if needed. Pancreatic fistulas can lead to sepsis, malnutrition and other complications, such as skin excoriation. Our case serves as a reminder to constantly reassess care plans to address changes in an individual's clinical picture and to include pancreatic fistula in the differential diagnosis for patients with prior pancreatic injury.

# CONCLUSION:

A pancreatic-pleural fistula may initially manifest as a pleural effusion on chest X-ray. The differential diagnosis for any patient with a history of pancreatic injury who presents with new or unusual symptoms and fluid collections or drainage should include pancreatic fistula.
