# ABSTRACTS JGIM

# Aortopulmonary Window

On abdominal CT abdomen and pelvis there was marked diffuse, bulky and confluent upper abdominal, mesenteric and retroperitoneal adenopathy. The patient underwent mediastinal video assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) which showed papillary intralymphatic angioendothelioma (PILA). The patient was referred to a vascular anomalies' specialist and was prescribed Sirolimus for prophylaxis immunosuppressant therapy.

# IMPACT/DISCUSSION:

To our knowledge, less than 40 cases of PILA have been described in literature. Presently, there are diagnostic challenges for pathologists and providers given PILA's rarity and histological complexity to distinguish it from other vascular lesions and lymphoma. We present a new and unusual case of PILA with typical B symptoms and multifocal intra-abdominal lesions. Most case reports describe asymptomatic and external presentations. It is important to rely on final pathology prior to assuming lymphoma is the most likely diagnosis.

# CONCLUSION:

Premature closure is failure to consider alternative diagnoses after the initial impression is formed. This leads to diagnostic errors that can have substantial effects on our patients' lives. Rare diseases are often overlooked and we need to recognize PILA as a differential diagnosis for neoplasms of the lymphatic vascular origin.

# Primary Care of Individuals with Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities–An Opportunity for Education and Advocacy

Elizabeth "Betty" Kolod1; Irene Chern2. 1Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, NY; 2Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY. (Control ID #3185956)

# LEARNING OBJECTIVE #1:

Recognize individuals with intellectual and developmental disability as a health disparity population.

# LEARNING OBJECTIVE #2:

Explore features of high-quality care for individuals with IDD.

# CASE:

A 45-year-old woman with a history of depression, obesity, and seizure disorder presents for a routine visit with a new primary care provider (PCP). She has a fractured tooth from a violent encounter with her boyfriend and believes she may have recently had a seizure but is unable to provide more detail. She emigrated from Puerto Rico to the Bronx at age 5 and completed the 10th grade in special education; she is on disability due to chronic pain. She lost custody of four of her children due to former cocaine use and now cares for her two remaining children and her mother who is illiterate. Prior notes intermittently refer to "underlying cognitive issues" with no formal neuropsychological evaluation. She declines a home visit to evaluate safety and social support and departs with referrals to Neurology and domestic violence services.

# IMPACT/DISCUSSION:

Intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD) comprise lifelong limitations of intellectual, physical or emotional development and adaptation. Health disparities are socially-produced differences in burden of illness experienced on a population level; the CDC defines individuals with disabilities as a health disparity population. CDC researchers note a five-fold increase in rate of diabetes and more than two-fold increase in cardiovascular disease among individuals with IDD compared to the general public. This disparity is compounded in people of color with IDD, particularly Hispanic women. Furthermore, individuals with IDD are 1.5 times more likely to be victims of violence and face twice the rate of sexual assault—in one study 49% of persons with IDD experienced 10 or more sexual assaults. High quality care for patients with IDD requires an understanding of unique health risks and strategies for providing basic preventive care. Patients with IDD are at increased risk for obesity, substance use disorders, seizure disorders, mental illness and violent or sexual victimization. Major barriers to care for patients with IDD include communication challenges, inaccessible office design, and poor physician compensation contributing to lack of access to health professionals trained in IDD. These barriers can be addressed by increasing emphasis on IDD in medical education and public health research, clinical adaptation to patient capabilities, interprofessional coordination, and including caregivers in communication. By utilizing a patient-centered approach, PCPs can increase self-advocacy as well as inform physician advocacy for resources to address the disparities faced by this community.

# CONCLUSION:

Individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities have worse health outcomes. PCPs can address this health disparity through advocacy and familiarity with best practices in the care of individuals with IDD.

# Primary Neutrophilic Dermatosis Misdiagnosed as Necrotizing Port Site Infection

Ranish Patel; Shadi Dowlatshahi. Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, OR. (Control ID #3167602)

# LEARNING OBJECTIVE #1:

Recognize clinical features of neutrophilic dermatoses.

# LEARNING OBJECTIVE #2:

Recognize the significant overlap in clinical presentations of neutrophilic dermatoses and severe infection.

# CASE:

52-year-old man with myelodysplastic syndrome status post 2 cycles of azacitadine, recent port placement who presented to an outside hospital with painful, erythematous port site. He denied any fevers, chills or sweats. Vitals were notable for tachycardia. Physical exam revealed confluent erythema over the area of the port, extending up to the neck. Labs were significant for WBC 19 x 103/μL. Vancomycin, clindamycin, and piperacillin-tazobactam were started empirically. Surgery was consulted, and the port was removed with copious pus noted at the port site, alongside gas-forming bubbles in the skin. The patient subsequently underwent debridement of the area, with healthy fascial and muscular tissue seen. However, the lesion was noted to continue to expand beyond the surgical margins into a 16 x 9cm necrotic ulcer with a pink-red indurated, and undermined edges. Follow up blood and wound cultures were all negative for pathologic organisms. The patient was transferred to our hospital for further management. Dermatology was consulted, and biopsy was performed. Histopathology demonstrated marked numbers of neutrophils present extending from the surface into the underlying adipose tissue. A diagnosis of pyoderma gangrenosum versus necrotizing Sweet syndrome was made. Antibiotics were discontinued, and the patient was started on a 2-month course of high-dose prednisone and dapsone. The wound displayed marked improvement and healed by secondary intention.

# IMPACT/DISCUSSION:

This case illustrates the potential for misdiagnosis of necrotizing skin infection in those with primary neutrophilic dermatosis, particularly in patients with compromised immune function. Common distinguishing features include associations with systemic diseases (i.e. hematologic malignancies, inflammatory bowel disease), and sterile, neutrophilic infiltrate on histopathology. Additionally, while not exhibited in all cases, the phenomenon of pathergy is frequently present. In these cases, skin injury is induced or exacerbated at sites of both incidental or iatrogenic trauma, as was seen with our patient. Appropriate diagnosis and management is therefore critical, as aggressive debridement has the potential to cause significant expansion of primary lesions, which in turn warrant further unnecessary resections resulting in significant morbidity.

# CONCLUSION:

It is important to consider primary neutrophilic dermatoses in patients with suspected severe skin infections, particularly in patients who are immunocompromised. Appropriate and timely diagnosis is critical, as delayed management can often result in significant patient morbidity.
