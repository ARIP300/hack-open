# Recovery Theme 6: Recovery is Supported and Sustained by the Development of Recovery Capital

Recovery capital is critical to an individual’s ability to recover from a SUD and represents the totality of internal and external resources that a person can draw upon to initiate and sustain the recovery process (Cloud & Granfield, 2008). Individual differences exist in the level of recovery capital when initiating recovery efforts and the rate of developing recovery capital during the recovery process. Researchers have identified various recovery capital dimensions, though considerable overlap exists across taxonomies (Hennessy, 2017). Cloud and colleagues (Cloud & Granfield, 2008; White & Cloud, 2008) proposed the most widely used taxonomy of recovery capital, shown in Table 3.

Conceptual and empirical research on recovery capital has focused primarily on the benefits bestowed by various types of recovery capital. However, Cloud & Granfield (2008) noted that although the general classes of recovery capital can support SUD recovery, they also can undermine recovery efforts under various circumstances, which they referred to as negative recovery capital. For example, developing strong relationships with non‑substance‑using peers (i.e., positive recovery capital) can help individuals become and remain abstinent. In contrast, maintaining strong relationships with peers who use substances (i.e., negative recovery capital), though providing positive outcomes such as a sense of belonging and identity, can create a hazard that undermines the initiation and sustainability of recovery efforts. Therefore, successful recovery efforts may depend on the net effect of simultaneously reducing negative recovery capital and increasing positive recovery capital.

# What is Workplace Supported Recovery?

As the above discussion suggests, recovery from a SUD can be a complex, dynamic, and heterogeneous process. However, one recurring theme in the recovery literature is the importance of employment (e.g., Borrelli et al., 2017; Brown & Ashford, 2019; Grover & Paylor, 2010; Laudet & White, 2010; Monaghan & Wincup, 2013; Room, 1998; Worley, 2017). In essence, employment represents a critical environmental context in which employees’ SUD recovery process unfolds. Recognizing the significant role
