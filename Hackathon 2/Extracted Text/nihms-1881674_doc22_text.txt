# Research Proposition 6a

Formal workplace social control targeting substance misuse will increase the likelihood of (a) initiating unassisted and treatment‑assisted recovery efforts, (b) of achieving or sustaining abstinence, and (c) achieving broad recovery outcomes such as growth in positive recovery capital and improved physical, psychological, and social well‑being.

# Research Proposition 6b

Informal workplace social control—structural and contextual features of work that increase the visibility of work performance—will increase the likelihood of (a) initiating unassisted and treatment‑assisted recovery efforts, (b) achieving or sustaining abstinence, and (c) achieving broad recovery outcomes such as growth in positive recovery capital and improved physical, psychological, and social well‑being.

# Organizational Support

Organizations can embody either a marginal capital or a human capital view of employees. The marginal capital view characterizes employees as low value, disposable, and lacking talent and drive. In contrast, the human capital view characterizes employees as making valuable contributions, warranting time and resources to develop skills, and only discharged under exceptional circumstances (Eisenberger & Stinglhamber, 2011).

Organizational support theory posits that employees develop a general perception of how an organization values their contributions and cares about their well‑being, referred to as perceived organizational support (POS; Eisenberger & Stinglhamber 2011). Employees who report high levels of POS also report work environments consistent with the human capital view, where there are high levels of positive work conditions and low levels of negative work conditions (Kurtessis et al., 2017).

Perceived organizational support creates a social bond between employees and organizations based on social exchange. Individuals reciprocate the organization’s valuing of their contributions and well‑being by increasing performance and their affective attachment to the organization (Kurtessis et al., 2017). Social bonding with the organization also increases because high POS fulfills socio‑emotional needs, such as approval, esteem, affiliation, and emotional support (Eisenberger & Stinglhamber, 2011; Kurtessis et al., 2017).

As with the social control framework discussed earlier, a strong social bond with the organization may motivate individuals to engage in responsible behavior and refrain from substance misuse that can undermine their job performance. The difference between social control theory and organizational support theory is the process underlying the social bond. In the social control framework, a social bond with the organization develops through organizational monitoring and shaping normative behavior. In contrast, in the organization support framework, employees develop a social bond with the organization because it values employees’ contributions and well‑being and provides a work environment that allows employees to flourish (Eisenberger & Stinglhamber, 2011; Kurtessis et al., 2017).

Consistent with expectations based on organizational support theory, one study reported a negative association between POS and employee alcohol misuse among military personnel (Wright et al., 2012). A second study reported that high POS indirectly reduced alcohol use among retail store employees by reducing levels of anger (O’Neill et al., 2009). Although no research has explored the association of POS with SUD recovery, there are reasons to believe that POS may support recovery. Organizations with high POS have work.
