# ADVOCACY EDUCATION IN CLERKSHIPS

Advocacy education in clerkships was important to their professional development, yet only 26% agreed that they had received formal education on this. Pre-curriculum, 35% of students agreed that they felt confident in their skills to advocate for patients in the inpatient setting; this increased to 100% post-curriculum. 93% of students agreed this curriculum helped them work closely with patients to ensure they received equitable care. Qualitative comments about what students mostly valued included themes related to advocacy education (e.g., "The ability to teach all of us that these are tangible factors that can radically change one's outcome when dc'd from the hospital") and the SW/CM interactive components of this curriculum.

# DISCUSSION / REFLECTION / LESSONS LEARNED

We hope to prepare all students to advocate for better patient health outcomes and health equity. Our survey results indicate our curriculum improved students' confidence and skills in patient advocacy topics. Their assignment and debriefing sessions allowed critical time for meaningful reflection. Student feedback has been critical to the evolution of the curriculum. Faculty development surrounding patient advocacy education has been instrumental in the implementation of this project, and we encourage other institutions to incorporate patient advocacy skills education into their clerkship curricula.

# A MULTIFACETED APPROACH TO INCREASE TRAINEE SCHOLARLY ACTIVITY

Shradha A. Kulkarni. Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX. (Control ID #3187004)

# NEEDS AND OBJECTIVES

Due to the clinical rigors of residency, time to pursue extracurricular scholarly activity can be limited for residents. Additionally, mentorship and support for research endeavors is also variable among residency programs. At Baylor College of Medicine (BCM), the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) annual program evaluation survey identified scholarly activity as an area in which to potentially improve. To directly address this need, a task force was created and developed the following multifaceted innovation.

# SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS

This innovation involved medical students on the internal medicine core clerkship and residents in the internal medicine residency program at Baylor College of Medicine, and took place as an after-hours, voluntary session on campus.

# DESCRIPTION

First, to increase awareness regarding opportunities for scholarly activity, an extensive list of local, regional, and national academic conferences was compiled and distributed to all residents and medical students. The list was organized by specialty and included submission deadlines, conference locations, and dates. Next, a workshop was held in which faculty members provided general tips and suggestions for writing an abstract to submit to a conference. The final portion of this innovation was the poster workshop, which was held three times during the year. The workshop began with a brief introduction with tips for creating effective poster and oral presentations. Subsequently, medical students and residents practiced presenting rough drafts of their posters to a mock judging panel comprised of faculty members, several of whom have served on abstract review committees or judging panels for conferences.

# EVALUATION

The number of abstract submissions and acceptances to academic conferences were tracked before and after the innovation was created.

# DISCUSSION / REFLECTION / LESSONS LEARNED

After the above interventions began in 2017, abstract submissions and acceptances to academic conferences have increased. For the Texas chapter of the American College of Physicians annual meeting (TxACP), the total number of posters/oral presentations by students and residents in 2015 and 2016 were 15 and 19, respectively. After development of this innovation, the number increased in 2017 and 2018 to 25 and 26, respectively. This innovation has both increased awareness and scholarly activity output by 50% by trainees at BCM. The most striking impact has been on medical students, as the number of student presentations at TxACP has increased over 300% from 6 in 2015 to 20 in 2018. Residents played an integral role as most student presentations included at least one resident as a co-author.

# A NOVEL CONTRACEPTION COUNSELING AND SHARED DECISION MAKING CURRICULUM: IMPACT ON RESIDENT KNOWLEDGE AND ATTITUDES

# NEEDS AND OBJECTIVES

After completion of this curriculum residents will be able to: 1. Discuss a patient's reproductive goals. 2. Engage a patient in a Shared Decision Making (SDM) conversation including counsel a patient on contraception options including discussing efficacy. 3. Identify contraindications and common side effects of these options. 4. Explore a patient's values and concerns surrounding contraception.

# SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS

IM and Med/Peds PGY-2-4 residents at a single institution participated in the curriculum. This included a 1-hour large group, interactive teaching session with the use of an original educational video. The initial needs assessment was distributed a year prior to the curriculum and the post survey was performed immediately following the curriculum. Clinical faculty preceptors were also included in the initial needs assessment.

# DESCRIPTION

The 2014 CDC guideline states that PCPs should provide contraceptive counseling (CC) and prescribe the selected method. IM and Med/Peds physicians are responsible for providing care to medically complex women of reproductive age, yet past studies have shown that inadequate knowledge is a barrier to CC. The CHOICE study demonstrated an increase in long-acting reversible contraception (LARC) prescribing with a CC intervention highlighting that counseling is an important factor in reproductive planning. SDM is a method of patient-centered communication that has been shown to promote contraception adherence. We initiated an innovative curriculum to teach residents CC through the framework of SDM.

# EVALUATION

38 pre and 58 post-curriculum residents (48% and 73%) completed surveys. Residents reported improvement in comfort with CC overall (mean pre- 3.21, post- 3.58, p<0.001, scale 1="I need close supervision", and 5="I can teach this skill"). The greatest improvements were seen in comfort discussing efficacy, patient beliefs and negotiating a decision. 66% reported comfort with counseling on Nexplanon after the curriculum (37% pre). Gains were seen in most of the questions focused on medical knowledge (IUDs and PID, 95% correct post versus 59% pre). Residents found the video to be a helpful tool (90% felt the video helped with discussing contraception options). Residents and faculty both under recognized teratogenic risk (13% faculty and 11% residents correctly identify teratogens unchanged with curriculum). The faculty survey revealed a gap in contraceptive knowledge and comfort with teaching these topics. 22% felt they had not received adequate training. Only 17% of faculty reported comfort teaching this skillset. Though 78% of faculty feel it is very important that residents learn about contraception.

# DISCUSSION / REFLECTION / LESSONS LEARNED

Prior to this curriculum, residents felt that CC was important, but lacked knowledge and training. This curriculum successfully addresses gaps in comfort and knowledge with CC including the use of LARC. Residents feel that the video...
