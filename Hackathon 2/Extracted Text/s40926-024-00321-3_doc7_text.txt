# Philosophy of Management

that we no longer question them or view them as merely one set among other possible sets; we view them as the only proper set. They become, that is, our default, and largely unquestioned, rules of practical judgment, and we come to regard the “proper” sentiments they entail not just as derivative from our particular experience but as objectively true for all.

# The Effects of Business Dominance

With his account of sentiment formation in mind (TMS), Smith worried in WN about the debilitating effects that extreme division of labor could have on workers’ mental abilities and moral character. These effects resulted, he argued, from two aspects of extreme division of labor: the repetition of tasks and the simple nature of the repeated tasks. By implication, the deleterious consequences could be alleviated or avoided by allowing workers to change tasks periodically, by adding to the number of tasks they do, or by giving them more complex tasks to accomplish, all of which would summon their creativity and innovation.

We contend that Smith’s argument from TMS can apply to workers in a way that not only extends his own discussion of the deleterious effects of extreme division of labor but also supports Anderson’s own worries. In particular, company leaders often create and maintain work environments in which employees suffer the deleterious consequences of a division of labor that retrains their sentiments and commands their obedience based on a felt need for employees to obey their bosses. True, many workers do not spend their whole working lives repeatedly doing only a few simple tasks. Still, adults do spend a great deal of their time “on the job”—often more time than in any other single activity, including sleep. Given Smith’s argument in TMS, this means that the conventions, mores, and culture of their business life could well have a greater effect on the continuing development of their sentiments and judgment than any other aspect of their lives. Thus if, as Anderson claims, the culture of their professional activity is one of dominance and subordination, of government and obedience, then this dynamic will affect their personalities deeply. Many workers might eventually come to believe not only that their bosses should be obeyed for prudential or strategic reasons but instead that it is right to obey their bosses. If so, the option of disobedience, even if (say) legally allowed, will become less salient to them, less of a real alternative. In time, it might lose its viability altogether. Some such workers might even become, de facto if not de jure, unable to conceive of themselves as equal in moral agency to their bosses, and, consciously or not, they might begin to internalize a subservient and subordinate personality. They might even voluntarily acquiesce in the “dictatorship” of their employers. And giving “more voice,” as Anderson suggests, to workers already substantially gripped by this injurious psychological dynamic might, unfortunately, do little to challenge the status quo relation of dominance and submission.

Consider more of what Anderson says about what we shall call the “dominance dynamic” in contemporary firms (2017, pp. 37–38):
