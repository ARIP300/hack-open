Among individuals with a substance use disorder, national research in the U.S. on alcohol and cannabis use shows that approximately 53% have a mild disorder, 23% have a moderate disorder, and 24% have a severe disorder (Grant et al., 2015; Hasin et al., 2016).

# What is Recovery from a Substance Use Disorder?

The concept of recovery has gained momentum in the U.S. and other countries as a conceptual lens for understanding SUDs and their management (Kelly et al., 2018; Kelly & Hoeppner, 2015; National Academies of Sciences‑Engineering‑Medicine, 2016b; White, 2007b). In general terms, recovery refers to an “organizing framework for approaching substance use disorders as a chronic disorder from which individuals can recover, so long as they have access to evidence‑based treatments and responsive long‑term supports” (Office of the Surgeon General, 2016, p. 5 − 1). Recovery does not necessarily represent a cure. Instead, it represents a state of “being and becoming” (Sheedy & Whitter, 2009, p. 11), where some people may always consider themselves in recovery and others may eventually view themselves as fully recovered (UK Drug Policy Commission, 2008).

In more specific terms, the concept of “recovery”—being “in recovery” or being “recovered”—has been defined in many different ways (Ashford et al., 2019; el‑Guebaly, 2012; Kelly & Hoeppner, 2015; White, 2007a). Table 2 provides several definitions of recovery, advanced by various organizations and researchers. Despite variation across these definitions, we observe among them and in related literature several general themes in the recovery process.

# Recovery Theme 1: Different Definitions of Recovery

For many researchers and recovery advocates, recovery begins with the development of long‑term abstinence (i.e., sobriety) from all psychoactive substances, whereas others disagree with this general stance. Specifically, there exist two related points of discussion. The first point of discussion is whether long‑term abstinence from all psychoactive substances is necessary for recovery. In other words, can individuals be in recovery if they maintain a level of use that is perceived to be less harmful or substitute a substance that they perceive to be less harmful? As shown in Table 2, the first two definitions suggest a need to achieve long‑term abstinence from all substances (alcohol, illegal drugs, and nonmedical prescription drug use). The third definition refers to “voluntarily‑sustained control over substance use.” The remaining two definitions do not mention abstinence or any level of use to broadly include who is in recovery or recovered (Recovery Science Research Collaborative, Ashford et al., 2019). Another reason is that a growing literature shows that the resolution of SUD symptoms is possible for many individuals who develop a level of use that they perceive to be less harmful, at least among those with mild to moderate SUDs (Stea et al., 2015; White, 2007a; Witkiewitz, 2020). A U.S. national survey found that some individuals with SUDs affirm this broader definition, reporting that 23.6% of those in recovery were not abstinent from their problematic substance(s), and 40.9% were not abstinent from all drugs and alcohol (Kelly, Abry, et al., 2018).

Although some definitions of SUD recovery propose that abstinence is required for a person to be in recovery, others either directly or indirectly suggest that both abstinence and nonabstinence goals are consistent with SUD recovery. Several overlapping terms
