required should be collected. Overall, GDRP strengthens consumers’ fundamental rights in the digital age. So much for the theory.

Unfortunately, practice still looks a bit different. In 2018, as part of the project ‘‘Market Watch Digital World’’, the Consumer Association of North Rhine-Westphalia (Verbraucherzentrale NRW) investigated how certain social media providers deal with selected rules of the GDPR (Moll et al. 2018). The results show a poor implementation of the GDPR by the examined social media providers. Privacy policies contain vague and unclear wording so that consumers still can hardly understand, how and by whom their data is being processed and used.

Regarding ‘‘privacy by default’’, there is also still some catching up to do. Default settings users are confronted with during the account registration often are not privacy-friendly. For example, with most of the examined social media services, user-generated content is publicly visible by default rather than only visible for contacts selected by the respective user. Furthermore, the majority of the social media providers monitors their users’ browsing activities by default and analyzes the collected data to serve personalized advertising.

In addition, the Market Watch Digital World team tested how selected social media providers respond to ‘‘request of information’’ and ‘‘request of getting a copy of personal data’’ (Scheibel et al. 2019). As stated in the GDPR, users (in the GDPR called ‘‘data subject’’) have the right to obtain from, e.g., a service provider confirmation as to whether or not personal data concerning him or her is being processed, and, where that is the case, they have the right to access the respective personal data. As part of the ‘‘right to data portability’’, which is another key new principle that has been included in the GDPR, users have the right to receive a copy of their personal data in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format. However, results of the test show that most of the social media providers answered inadequately. They solely referred to their general privacy policies or to their support site instead of giving the specifically requested information as provided by the GDPR. With regard to the ‘‘request of getting a copy of personal data’’, some of the social media providers sent a link for downloading personal data stored about the respective user. However, in most of the cases, downloaded data was only available in unstructured form and various file formats that, partially, could not be opened with standard software. Thus, consumers are not able to use the downloaded data packets in order to make informed decisions regarding the transmission of their data to, for example, another social media provider.

Other studies, such as the one conducted by researchers of the University of Göttingen commissioned by the Federal Ministry of Justice and Consumer Protection (Wiebe and Helmschrot 2019), also conclude that there is still a lot to do when it comes to the practical implementation of GDPR. One important step in this connection would be to equip responsible parties such as data protection authorities with adequate resources to facilitate a stronger enforcement of GDPR. Only if requirements are consistently implemented by service providers or data controllers will consumers be able to exercise their rights in practice so that GDPR can achieve the desired effects.

# 6 The GDPR from a Perspective of Consumer Informatics

Gunnar Stevens, Information Systems esp. IT-Security and Privacy, University of Siegen

From the point of view of consumer informatics, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) represents an important step towards the reorganization of data protection for a digital society. A statement from the point of view of consumer informatics can be related to two levels: Firstly, it can address the level of the concrete organization and conversion. There is certainly much that can be criticized here, e.g. whether the threats of punishment are appropriate, whether companies have been granted sufficient transitional periods, etc. In contrast, this contribution focuses on the second, the conceptual level and the spirit behind the GDPR.

In times of data capitalism and the increase of AI procedures in application systems, it is important to remember that from this point of view and for a modern, liberal society the principle of informational self-determination is a great asset, which is by no means natural, but must always be defended anew.

For individual mental hygiene, but also for social participation and political decision-making, citizens need retreats in which they are unobserved and can express themselves freely. This need is protected by the state through a number of defensive rights, such as the inviolability of homes or the secrecy of telecommunications. To the extent that life practices become digital, corresponding retreats are needed in the digitalized world. To secure such spaces and promote informational self-determination, three essential aspects are mentioned here as examples.

# 6.1 Access and Processing Control

Privacy is traditionally thought of in terms of space – it is therefore usually created by a physical access restriction or access control. The fact that consumer life increasingly takes place in the digital world (e.g., in social media and messengers) and at the same time existing places considered private are becoming ‘‘smart’’ (e.g., the home or the
