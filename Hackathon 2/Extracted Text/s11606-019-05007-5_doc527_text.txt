# Case 1: Advanced GBM and C1-Inhibitor Treatment

Cutaneous sites that was refractory to antihistamines, as well as progressive cerebral edema that did not respond to high dose corticosteroids. Despite a normal C1q, C4 and C1-inhibitor protein and function, C1-inhibitor treatment was started on 3/12/18 at 20 units/kg IV twice weekly, based on literature suggesting that edema may be bradykinin generated. The patient subsequently reported significant improvement in mental status. An MRI on 5/18/2018 confirmed reduced cerebral edema and midline shift after two months of treatment. He has since been maintained on C1-inhibitor infusions twice a week.

# IMPACT/DISCUSSION

GBM is one of the most common adult primary brain tumors. It has a poor prognosis with 5-year survival after radiation and temozolomide chemotherapy at 9.8%. It is thought that mesenchymal stem cells influence GBM invasiveness through cross-talk pathways that lead to an upregulation of bradykinin receptors. Further, bradykinin is also involved in the formation of vasogenic edema by disrupting the blood-brain barrier. Edema adds to the tumor's mass effect as it invades surrounding parenchyma, ultimately increasing intracranial pressure and contributing to overall morbidity and mortality. Treatment of cerebral edema usually entails corticosteroid therapy; however, if unresponsive, there are few additional medical therapies available. Recent research supports bradykinin's role in both tumor invasion and vasogenic edema, has led to interest in the usefulness of C1-esterase inhibitor as a potential therapy to decrease the amount of bradykinin generated by malignant GBM cells. Our case discusses a patient with advanced GBM who had diffuse edema refractory to steroid therapy, and responded well to recombinant C1-inhibitor. This success may help inspire future trials to explore the utility of this drug as an addition to the arsenal of available treatment modalities for highly aggressive glioblastomas.

# CONCLUSION

- GBM is an aggressive tumor that uses bradykinin pathways to advance its borders and distort the blood-brain barrier to create surrounding edema, which can worsen morbidity and mortality.
- C1-inhibitor works by inhibiting the contact activation system and thus reducing bradykinin levels available to the tumor.
- In a patient with vasogenic edema of the CNS that is refractory to other first-line therapies, C1-inhibitor may be a safe and effective option.

# Case 2: Disseminated Nocardiosis

And sent for additional testing, including nocardia cultures. When his cultures returned positive for nocardia veterana, he was immediately placed on intravenous trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. However, his clinical condition continued to deteriorate and he eventually succumbed to his infection one month after the diagnosis of disseminated nocardiosis was made.

# IMPACT/DISCUSSION

Nocardiosis is often an elusive diagnosis. The usual hallmarks of infection, such as fever and leukocytosis, can be lacking, particularly when the infection is limited to the skin prior to pulmonary involvement. Subcutaneous, pulmonary, and brain nodules, which have a neutrophil predominance on gram stain, are the most common sign. Cultures (blood/fluid), which require a fourteen day incubation period specifically for nocardia, are necessary for diagnosis. Early diagnosis is critical, since disseminated nocardiosis has mortality rates as high as 64% without appropriate treatment. Prompt initiation of therapy has been associated with reduction in mortality to 10%. Therefore, clinicians need to maintain a high degree of suspicion to diagnose patients quickly. Identifying risk factors for nocardiosis may help with early diagnosis. Risk factors include immunocompromised states, such as a history of HIV infection, lymphoma, and chronic treatment with high dose glucocorticoids. This patient had both of the later two risk factors. In the presence of subcutaneous nodules, attention to these risk factors may allow for earlier diagnosis and initiation of appropriate management for nocardiosis.

# CONCLUSION

Clinicians should be able to describe the risk factors and common presentation of disseminated nocardiosis in order to prevent delays in diagnosis that significantly raise mortality.

# LEARNING OBJECTIVE #2

Describe the risk factors for nocardiosis.

# Case 3: Dermatomyositis and Nocardiosis

A 70 year old man with a history of Hodgkin's lymphoma and Follicular lymphoma treated with chemotherapy one year prior, presented to the hospital due to diffuse subcutaneous nodules, rash and weakness. He had developed an erythematous, mildly painful rash that began on his back six months prior to admission, which progressed to disseminated subcutaneous nodules. He was diagnosed with dermatomyositis and was managed as an outpatient with high intensity glucocorticoids. A biopsy was obtained due to concerns for recurrent lymphoma, but returned with only neutrophils. A follow-up PET-CT scan showed innumerable lesions in the lungs, abdomen, diffuse subcutaneous and muscle tissues. A neck lesion was biopsied and cultured, and returned positive for possible actinomyces infection, at which time the patient was referred to the hospital. He had no other pertinent medical, surgical, family or social history apart from the fact that he had been an avid gardener up until six months ago at the onset of his symptoms. On admission, a repeat culture of a biopsy of a nodule in the neck was obtained.

# Case 4: Respiratory Distress and Lymphadenopathy

A 77-year-old male with medical history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease on home oxygen, diabetes, hypertension and heart failure with reduced ejection fraction presented with 1 day of worsening shortness of breath, dry cough, orthopnea and lower extremity swelling. Other review of systems unremarkable. Physical exam notable for blood pressure 172/92 mmHg, oxygen saturation 96% on 2 L nasal cannula, labored breathing, decreased breath sounds in right lung base, bibasilar crackles, pitting edema in lower extremities up to abdomen, and soft and nontender bilateral cervical, axillary, and inguinal lymphadenopathy.
