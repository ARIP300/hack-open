# NEEDS AND OBJECTIVES:

The University of Colorado Denver Health Longitudinal Integrated Clerkship (DH-LIC) is based at an urban safety-net hospital. Nationally, there is variability in how post-clerkship students and medical schools structure learning,1 and debate over best utilization of this time. A needs assessment of DH-LIC students (n=12) demonstrated high interest in a post-clerkship elective. Based on these results, the Longitudinal Social Medicine Elective (LSME) was implemented and encompasses a mentored project and a course in social medicine. Primary goals were to allow students to continue mentorship relationships with faculty, engage in mentored scholarly work, and further develop knowledge and skills in social medicine.

# SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS:

Students in the DH-LIC were eligible to enroll in the LSME during their fourth year. Currently, the elective is in its second year and has enrolled nine students over two years (from 16 eligible LIC students).

# DESCRIPTION:

Students identify a capstone project in the umbrella areas of medical education, community engagement, or quality improvement (QI). The course also includes a week-long intensive course in social medicine encompassing topics such as trauma-informed care, implicit bias, correctional care, and health care for the homeless, as well as service learning and reflective writing. The capstone of the course is student presentations of project work to peers, faculty and health system and community leaders. Illustrative examples of projects include: utilization of palliative care in the SICU, a qualitative study of impact of LIC students on patient satisfaction, development of a radiology curriculum for LIC students, implementation of a service learning curriculum for LIC students, and a collaborative QI project to improve primary care engagement for patients with serious mental illness.

# EVALUATION:

Students rated their overall satisfaction with the course as high to very high (100%) and all students felt this elective filled an important gap in their education. 100% reported their interest in practicing at Denver Health after residency was high or very high at completion of the longitudinal immersive course. To assess long-term impact on career focus on underserved care, scholarly work and advocacy, graduates of the program will be surveyed annually.

# DISCUSSION / REFLECTION / LESSONS LEARNED:

Strengths of this innovation include meaningful projects that serve the Denver Health community and allow students to produce scholarly work. Student participation strengthened student commitment to the underserved and understanding of social medicine.

# STUDENT-DIRECTED COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT PROJECTS AS A LEARNING LABORATORY FOR PHYSICIAN LEADERSHIP - A SIX-YEAR EXPERIENCE

# NEEDS AND OBJECTIVES:

Two challenges facing medical schools in fostering students as leaders in community-engaged healthcare are: a) few leadership curricula include content based on medical students' perceived needs, and b) true collaborations between students and community-based organizations (CBOs) (as opposed to service-learning) are difficult due to student turnover and full curricula. Our objective was to design a community-based ‘learning laboratory' to promote leadership skills in academic-community collaboration through reflection-on-action.

# SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS:

Second year medical students in an elective co-curriculum in health disparities at University of Michigan Medical School from 2012 to 2017.

# DESCRIPTION:

Each year, teams of 4-6 students were tasked to engage with a CBO of their choice over 5-7 months to complete a ‘Mini Field Project'. Initially the assignment was kept small, requiring only structured interviews or site visits. Later, the task was expanded to require collaborating with a CBO to design and complete a project resulting in a ‘deliverable' to the CBO. At the mid- and endpoints of the assignment teams wrote structured reflective narratives on physician leadership and organizational collaboration. After completion teams presented their projects to each other using persuasive, creative formats. Over the six years, 174 students formed 45 teams to engage with 38 CBOs. 15 projects consisted of interviews only; 5 were site visits; and 25 were projects, 21 of which were completed.

# EVALUATION:

In early years, students' observations on physicians as leaders included traditional features of leadership (e.g., strategic vision) along with non-traditional domains (e.g., professional identity development, work-life balance). In later years prompts related to the non-traditional topics were included in the reflective narrative reports. Annual student feedback on the value of the Mini Field Projects was highly positive. Feedback on work burden for this extracurricular activity informed the size and scope of projects over time. A one-time survey of CBO experience (Year 2) was highly positive.

# DISCUSSION / REFLECTION / LESSONS LEARNED:

Mini Field Projects are now a standard component of the health disparities co-curriculum, and have been highlighted by the medical school as exemplary community engagement by our students. Our next goals are to continue projects at individual sites over several years, and involve students in other health professions schools to promote interprofessional education in community settings.

# SUCCESSFUL IMPLEMENTATION OF A REFLECTIVE PRACTICE CURRICULUM IN AN INTERNAL MEDICINE RESIDENCY TRAINING PROGRAM

# NEEDS AND OBJECTIVES:

Redesign of internal medicine programs has led to the transformation of the ambulatory experience to block scheduling systems. However, block schedules decrease continuity between learners and teachers with consequent challenges in developing longitudinal relationships that contribute to professional identity formation. Additionally, burnout during residency has led to an increased need for a forum to discuss factors that lead to burnout and its mitigation. This presentation outlines a novel approach using reflective practice to cultivate professional identity formation and promote continuity for faculty and trainees. It provides one platform to foster resilience, joy and meaning in medicine through an innovative curriculum.

# SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS:

The participants were 75 internal medicine residents and 30 faculty. Novel reflective practice tools were used successfully in a large internal medicine residency. There were 15 reflective practice groups, each consisting of 5 trainees/2 faculty facilitators. The reflective practice curriculum included readings, videos and TED talks, artwork and
