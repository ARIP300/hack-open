providers to medicalize distress due to the consequences of (Nkansah-Amankra et al., 2013). However, strong social ties and community are beneficial for mental health and mental disorders are more common among people with fewer friends and weaker community engagement (Hari, 2019). Involvement in community organizations has fallen 45% between 1985 and 1994, and for many, the immediate family is all that remains as a primary support structure (Hari, 2019). Marriage rates are also declining among white working class people without a college degree, which has been attributed to poor economic prospects (Anne & Angus, 2020). Researchers John and Stephanie Cacioppo have argued that loneliness is a risk factor for symptoms and anxiety and depression (Cacioppo et al., 2014). Loneliness has been described as an epidemic due to dramatic increases in perceived loneliness since 1980 (Hari, 2019). Union participation was once a source of community for workers, but decreases in union participation has caused this community to disappear (Anne & Angus, 2020). Wealth inequality has also been cited as a cause of increased loneliness as levels of trust in others has been found to be lower in countries with greater wealth inequality when compared to countries with lesser wealth inequality (Wilkinson & Pickett, 2011). This is likely also due to competitive attitudes toward others due to ideologies of neoliberal capitalism and competition for social status (Wilkinson & Pickett, 2011). Social relationships appear to be better in more egalitarian countries including better social cohesion and trust, involvement in community life, and lower levels of violence (Wilkinson & Pickett, 2011).

# Neoliberal Ideologies Contributing to Emotional Distress

Neoliberal ideologies, as mentioned above, have also contributed to distress. Neoliberalism encourages individualism, which has decreased emphasis on the need for community and social connection for fulfillment. Since individualism is viewed as a desirable moral characteristic, asking for help, especially financially, is frowned upon. With complete faith in the free market to provide for all who wish to work, people who do not achieve financial success are blamed for their misfortunes increasing the stigma of poverty. Attitudes toward people who receive government financial assistance can elicit feelings of shame from those who receive benefits (Hansen et al., 2014). Neoliberalism also encourages consumerism and when people adopt materialistic values they are more likely to have symptoms of anxiety and depression with poorer relationships and lower self-esteem (James, 2008). Neoliberal capitalism has also led to mass incarceration and poverty particularly in minority populations (Nkansah-Amankra et al., 2013). Racism and neoliberal ideologies have justified the creation of a disposable population who are viewed as criminals that are unwilling to work (Nkansah-Amankra et al., 2013). Although it is unclear what is causing increasing suicide rates in Black adolescents, past injustices make it difficult for minorities to escape their financial situations likely leading to hopelessness and poor mental health (Sounding the alarm on black youth suicide, n.d.). Putting high values on status and constantly competing and comparing oneself to others is exhausting and does not provide what humans need for fulfillment (James, 2008).
