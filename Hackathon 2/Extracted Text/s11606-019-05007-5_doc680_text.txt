# ABSTRACTS

# DESCRIPTION

Each perspective covers a different aspect of the patient's history. The Disease Perspective encourages the provider to synthesize objective and subjective information into a physical or mental diagnosis; this Perspective is incomplete without the other three. The Behavior Perspective identifies what actions the patient is taking that impact her disorder; examples include substance abuse and addictions. The Dimensions Perspective challenges the learner to think about the personal characteristics of the patient, and may include health literacy, level of perceived trust, and the provider's own interpersonal chemistry with the patient. Finally, the Life-story Perspective expands the concept of "social history" and asks the learner to gain an understanding of the patients' background.

# EVALUATION

Thirteen residents each participated in a session. In post-session surveys, 83 % found that it was useful for their patient, and many commented that they understood their patients better. Only 58 % felt that they had met applied the Perspectives, although in a chart review by the preceptor of their patient notes, 67 % incorporated the Perspectives. Thirty-three percent of residents reported a high positive impact on their patient care skills.

# DISCUSSION / REFLECTION / LESSONS LEARNED

Teaching and observing medical history taking is a time-intensive process; importantly, this teaching can allow learners better understanding of their patients. This pilot suggests that learners may benefit from the following: further adaptation of the Four Perspectives for the non-psychiatric general medical setting, and a longitudinal method of instruction.

# EVALUATION

A total of 14 primary care residents rotated through HOPE clinic one time in the first 6 months of the academic year. Prior to attending HOPE clinic, residents expressed feeling low confidence in the all assessed domains but reported increase in confidence after the session. The change in confidence level was:

- conducting a comprehensive pain assessment (average score pre = 2.8 and post = 3.9)
- safely prescribing opioids (pre = 2.5 and post = 3.4)
- recognizing and managing concerning behaviors in patients on COT (pre= 2.5 and post = 3.5)
- creating a treatment plan for chronic pain (pre = 2.8 and post = 3.2)
- identifying substance use disorder in patients on COT (pre = 2.1 and post = 3.4)
- treating substance use disorders in primary care (pre = 2.3 and post = 3.3)

Residents report feeling a great deal of stress working with patients with chronic pain and substance use with slight improvement by one-half point on a Likert scale after the session. All residents agreed they enjoyed the clinical learning experience.

# DISCUSSION / REFLECTION / LESSONS LEARNED

Resident physicians face stress and uncertainty when managing chronic pain and opioid therapy. A clinical learning experience with guided mentorship can improve resident confidence and decrease stress when working on these complex issues.

# NEEDS AND OBJECTIVES

In the era of the opioid epidemic and tightening regulations on prescribing opioid medications, resident physicians are increasingly uncomfortable with the management of chronic opioid therapy (COT). Additionally, attending practice patterns differ dramatically leaving residents with uncertainty. We sought to create a structured clinical learning experience for primary care residents on a patient-centered approach to the management of chronic pain and opioids.

# SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS

HOPE clinic is a multi-disciplinary, once weekly clinic based in an academic primary care clinic based at the county hospital, Zuckerberg San Francisco General (ZSFG). The team includes pharmacy, quality improvement, and physicians with addiction medicine training. The primary care clinic has 24 primary care residents and 23 categorical from the UCSF Internal Medicine residency program.

# DESCRIPTION

Primary care residents in their second or third year rotate through the clinic twice per year. Each session has a dedicated curricular topic on chronic pain management. Residents see patients alongside the physician supervisor with the focus of the visit on management of chronic pain and opioids and motivational interviewing communication skills. Additionally, we discuss a plan of care for all resident primary care patients on COT and residents present patients with complex chronic pain or substance use issues. Residents were given a survey to assess confidence with managing pain and COT before and after each clinic session on a 5 point Likert-like scale (1 = not confident through 5 = very confident).

# NEEDS AND OBJECTIVES

In response to feedback received from our hospitalized patients about opportunities for improved cultural and religious sensitivity, we were determined to help our faculty promote and sustain culturally and linguistically appropriate services, and effectively interact with individuals from diverse backgrounds. The purpose of this project was to improve provider cultural competency.

# SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS

Setting: Large, tertiary care, academic medical center. Participants: Hospital Medicine physician faculty.

# DESCRIPTION

As the U.S. population becomes more diverse, Hospital staff need to be better educated to care for patients of varying cultural and social backgrounds. More than half of all U.S. babies born today are people of color, and by 2050 our nation will have no clear racial or ethnic majority. As such, the authors created and enacted a diversity curriculum within the division of hospital medicine designed to educate faculty and help minimize cultural barriers that may exist between them and the diverse patient population they serve.

# EVALUATION

Using a questionnaire, a baseline assessment was conducted of staff's perception of their cultural competency. The findings validated the authors' hypothesis that a diversity curriculum was needed. The curriculum was developed and involved a multifaceted and asynchronous approach. A monthly lecture series was created with each one dedicated to improving provider familiarity and knowledge of frequently encountered ethnic, religious, cultural, sexual orientation and gender identity groups from our community. Additionally, monthly newsletters which highlighted and provided background on numerous cultural holidays and religious observances were circulated via email and posted in staff work rooms. All staff who attended a lecture were surveyed monthly to obtain a longitudinal assessment of their knowledge and comfort level taking care of culturally diverse patients.
