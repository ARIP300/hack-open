and venetoclax. In the MRD cohort, this was followed by MRD-guided randomization. According to the most recent update, the fixed-duration cohort experienced a 4-year PFS rate of 79 % [11]. The phase III GLOW study led to the approval of ibrutinib plus venetoclax in many countries. Older patients and/or patients with comorbidities were randomized to either ibrutinib/venetoclax or chlorambucil/obinutuzumab. With respect to PFS, ibrutinib/venetoclax gave rise to a 78 % risk reduction (HR, 0.216; p < 0.001; Figure) [12].

# First-line triplets

Dr. Jain emphasized the time-limited nature of doublet and triplet therapies. This has some advantages such as decreased risk of resistance mutations and improved cost-effectiveness. Also, if patients progress after first-line combination regimens, unpublished data indicate that retreatment works.

In the first-line setting, several studies have investigated ibrutinib, acalabrutinib or zanubrutinib in addition to a backbone consisting of venetoclax and obinutuzumab (Ven + G). The CLL2-GIVe trial focused on ibrutinib plus Ven + G in patients with del(17p)/TP53-mutated CLL. In this population, the results were encouraging, with a 3-year PFS rate of 79.9 %, although the PFS curve suggested some late relapses [13]. Notable differences were observed regarding the type of aberration: while patients with TP53 mutation alone did not develop any relapses for more than three years, those with del(17p) with or without TP53 mutation fared considerably worse. Another study conducted in the high-risk setting tested the combination of acalabrutinib plus Ven + G. At cycle 16, high uMRD rates resulted across the total population and the patients with TP53 aberrations [14]. Similarly, the long-term follow-up of a phase II study has shown uMRD rates of 96 % and 92 % in the peripheral blood and bone marrow with zanubrutinib plus Ven + G [15].

As Dr. Jain pointed out, uMRD rates are numerically higher with second-generation BTK inhibitors than with ibrutinib, although this observation needs to be confirmed in a larger context. Ongoing phase III studies that are currently evaluating doublet and triplet regimens in the first-line setting will be reported over the next few years. Combination data for acalabrutinib plus venetoclax ± obinutuzumab and zanubrutinib plus venetoclax are awaited. Also, new BCL-2 inhibitors such as sonrotoclax and lisaftoclax are under development and will be assessed as part of combination strategies.
