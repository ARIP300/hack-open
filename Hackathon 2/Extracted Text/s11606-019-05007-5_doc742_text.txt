# ABSTRACTS

# DISCUSSION / REFLECTION / LESSONS LEARNED:

We recognized an untapped potential in having residents participate on hospital committees. At a teaching hospital, residents offer a unique perspective as they intersect with multiple disciplines and work at the front line of patient care. Thus, for a hospital initiative to achieve the fullest success, the buy-in of the resident stakeholder is paramount. For the resident, committees offer an opportunity to practice leadership, network with specialists in their desired field, and contribute to hospital projects.

# NEEDS AND OBJECTIVES:

Internal medicine (IM) residents have low confidence and satisfaction treating patients with chronic pain on chronic opioid therapy (COT). To address the dual aims of training residents about judicious opioid prescribing and providing guideline-adherent patient care, we developed a weekly resident teaching practice session for patients on COT, the Power Over Pain (POP) Clinic. We report on resident survey responses after completion of the 2-year curriculum.

# SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS:

POP Clinic is a weekly session at a large urban IM teaching practice in Bronx, NY that cares for 150 patients on COT. IM residents rotate through POP Clinic 8 times during their PGY2&3 years.

# DESCRIPTION:

Since 9/2016, all patients on COT must be seen in POP Clinic at least yearly. Residents in POP Clinic see 1-3 patients per session in hour-long visits precepted by two IM attendings with expertise in chronic pain and opioids. Residents receive 30-minute didactic lectures before each session on topics including opioid safety and efficacy, multimodal pain care, opioid use disorder, and interpreting urine drug tests. Precepting focuses on summarizing the risks and benefits of opioid therapy, optimizing medications and non-pharmacologic treatments, counseling patients, and naloxone provision.

# EVALUATION:

Residents completed an online survey prior to their first POP session during PGY2 (baseline) and at the end of PGY3 (post-POP). The survey assessed confidence and reward in managing patients on COT and experiences in the POP Clinic on a 5-point Likert scale from "strongly disagree" to "strongly agree." Paired t-tests were used to compare confidence and reward in the baseline and post-POP periods. Of 23 residents who received the full POP curriculum between 2016-2018, 21 (91%) completed both surveys and were included in the analysis. In the post-POP survey, residents agreed that POP Clinic improved their confidence in managing patients with chronic pain, their ability to perform comprehensive pain assessments and identify opioid use disorder, and their confidence in prescribing nonopioid pain medication (median response 4 for all items). Resident confidence in prescribing opioids significantly decreased from baseline (mean 3.8) to post-POP (mean 2.7, p<0.001). There was no significant difference in resident enjoyment in managing patients with chronic pain from baseline (mean 2.6) to post-POP (mean 2.3, p=0.23).

# DISCUSSION / REFLECTION / LESSONS LEARNED:

IM residents reported positive impact of POP Clinic on their confidence managing chronic pain and COT. However, confidence in opioid prescribing decreased and reward in managing patients with chronic pain was unchanged. The lack of improvement in confidence in opioid prescribing may reflect increased awareness of the challenges and risks associated with prescribing opioids and may suggest a need to revise the curriculum. Even with improved skills, it is challenging to increase resident enjoyment of managing patients with chronic pain.

# NEEDS AND OBJECTIVES:

Despite the widespread use of electronic health records (EHR), medical trainees continue to struggle with effectively navigating these systems. Evidence shows that the usual classroom training is insufficient for new EHR users, yet we found no studies that have evaluated or disseminated the effectiveness of alternative training methods. Consequently, we developed a comprehensive, "hands-on" training course for the incoming PGY1 residents with the aim of improving the competency and efficiency of their use with our EHR system.

# SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS:

Participants included all PGY1 Internal Medicine residents (n=12). The training sessions were led by PGY2 and PGY3 residents (n=18). Two faculty members administered pre- and post-EHR skill assessments independent from the training sessions.

# DESCRIPTION:

Each year, incoming interns participate in a 4-hour classroom EHR training taught by the on-campus EHR specialist during their orientation week. For this project, we administered an assessment to evaluate the interns' understanding and utilization of basic functions of Centricity EHR after the conventional training was completed. From these results, we identified common problem areas and deficiencies that required correction. We designed a comprehensive resident-led training that included placing orders, e-prescribing medications, reviewing labs and test results, etc. The training was delivered during the first week of +1 ambulatory block and consisted of a one-hour noon session from Monday to Thursday for a total of four sessions. The interns completed a post-assessment at the conclusion of the training.

# EVALUATION:

Twelve PGY-1 residents were evaluated using a 13-item workflow skills assessment tool. The assessment required the intern to demonstrate each function/skill in real-time with each skill graded based on the ability to complete tasks independently, with assistance, or needing additional training. Before the training, 27.9% of interns were able to perform basic EHR tasks independently. After the training, 90.5% of participants achieved competency. The overall difference between pre- and post-tests was statistically significant (p<.001).

# DISCUSSION / REFLECTION / LESSONS LEARNED:

While EHR systems are becoming a necessity in all clinics, training, specifically for residents, remains subpar. We demonstrated that conventional EHR training is insufficient and that resident-based training has a significant impact on the effective utilization of EHR in everyday clinical situations.

# RESIDENT-LED REVIEW SESSION FOR THE INTERNAL MEDICINE CORE CLERKSHIP

# NEEDS AND OBJECTIVES:

Every year, over 20,000 students matriculate to medical schools in the United States. Every one of these students are required to complete the core clerkships including Internal Medicine (IM).
