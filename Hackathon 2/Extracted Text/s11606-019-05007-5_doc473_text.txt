# LEARNING OBJECTIVE #1:

Recognize the complications of aortic root replacement in patients with Marfan syndrome.

# LEARNING OBJECTIVE #2:

Assess the risk by careful follow-up studies after the surgical procedure to diagnose such complications.

# CASE:

A 62-year-old female with Marfan syndrome who previously had an aortic root replacement with Bentall valve procedure and the mechanical valve conduit at the age of 34 presented with chest pain. One week before she underwent elective ureteroscopy and bilateral ureteral stent placement for bilateral hydronephrosis. Three days after the procedure she developed chest pain with nausea and diaphoresis. Patient denies fevers, chills, cough; pain is not radiating to back/shoulders. She is not a smoker or drinks alcohol. Her past medical history includes CVA at the age of 38, hyperlipidemia, recurrent nephrolithiasis, UTI's. Family history includes hypertension, type II DM in mother and father, Marfan syndrome in her son. She is on warfarin for lifelong anticoagulation for the mechanical aortic valve. Pulses are symmetrical over both extremities, hemoglobin is stable at 8 mg/dl, Initial EKG was negative for ischemic changes, but Troponin was elevated. Echocardiogram showed normal EF and mechanical aortic valve. CTA chest showed leaking pseudoaneurysm with peri-graft hemorrhage involving the ascending aorta, could originate from the right coronary ostium. Anticoagulation was held, increased beta-blocker dose to control heart rate (as the patient developed Atrial Fibrillation with RVR during inpatient) and to decrease shearing stress on the aorta. Cardiothoracic surgery recommended urgent surgical repair of aortic pseudoaneurysm.

# IMPACT/DISCUSSION:

The Bentall procedure is considered the gold standard in the treatment of patients requiring aortic root replacement. The vast majority of Bentall procedures involve the replacement of the aortic root with a mechanical valve conduit. Pseudoaneurysm formation at the coronary ostia or at the distal aortic suture line is a frequently reported sequela of the Bentall procedure. Pseudoaneurysms of the ascending aorta occur in from 7% to 25% of patients in whom the original inclusion/wrap technique of the Bentall procedure has been applied. The main causes of pseudoaneurysm formation are tension on suture lines, particularly those involving the coronary ostia. These pseudoaneurysms tend to remain small and asymptomatic, although they on occasions enlarge, cause compression of vital neighboring structures, can rupture, as in our patient, mandating urgent surgical intervention.

# CONCLUSION:

Elective aortic root replacement or repair in patients with Marfan syndrome is of paramount importance in order to prevent aortic dissections. Lifelong imaging of the entire aorta, using MRI or computed tomography, is needed to prevent devastating complications. Timely diagnosis and management of these complications (Pseudoaneurysm rupture, Aortic dissections, Aorto-atrial fistula) are warranted as they are life-threatening.

# LEGAL DRUGS WITH ILL EFFECTS: A CASE OF KRATOM AND PHENIBUT USE

# LEARNING OBJECTIVE #1:

Recognize patient perceptions and reasons for use of Kratom and Phenibut.

# LEARNING OBJECTIVE #2:

Utilize familiar medications for treatment of Kratom and Phenibut Use.

# CASE:

The patient is a 30-year-old male with a history of anxiety who presented to primary care asking for help stopping Kratom. The patient used 12 grams of powder Kratom 3 times daily for 5 years for anxiety symptoms. Two years ago, the patient stopped utilizing an internet protocol hydrocodone taper but resumed use 2 weeks later. With cessation, he experiences insomnia, restlessness, and nausea. He also reports taking daily Phenibut purchased on the internet for anxiety and low energy. His only prescribed medication was Citalopram. Physical exam was unremarkable and urine drug screen was negative for all illicit substances. The patient started on buprenorphine/naloxone (BNX) for Kratom use with resolution of his withdrawal symptoms. For Phenibut, he declined baclofen treatment. High resolution mass spectrometry on week 2 of treatment showed no active metabolites of Kratom but did show Phenibut. He has completely stopped using Kratom and tapered Phenibut use to 1-2 times weekly.

# IMPACT/DISCUSSION:

Kratom is a plant native to Southeast Asia with dose-dependent actions on the monoaminergic system and at the mu-opioid receptors (Hassan, Neuro & Bio Reviews, 2013). Recreational use of Kratom in the United States has increased; its purchase is legal in most states. Kratom is promoted on the internet for chronic pain, energy, and detox off opioids. Case reports describe the efficacy of BNX for kratom dependency (Khazeli, J Addict Med. 2018). Patients describe symptoms of anxiety and depression following cessation (Singh, J Psychoactive Drugs. 2018). This patient had prominent anxiety symptoms, likely due to his chronic condition made worse by kratom withdrawal, driving his co-consumption of phenibut. Phenibut is a gamma-aminobutyric acid type B agonist that is legally available from online retailers (Owen, Drug Al Rev. 2016). It has anxiolytic and euphoric effects and has been implicated in overdose cases (O'Connell, Amer J of Med. 2014). Case reports describe syndromes of dependence and withdrawal characterized by anxiety, agitation, insomnia, and tremors (Ahuja et al. Case Rep Psychiatry, 2018) and can be treated with Baclofen. There are no case reports that we are aware of describing patients with misuse of both substances simultaneously. These medicines are not detected by traditional testing and providers are unaware of patients' use of herbal medicines (Lee, J of Clin Onc, 2014). This case illustrates the importance of taking a thorough history for use of licit and illicit substances. This case illustrates low perceived risk in the public domain of legal substances. Providers and patients will need education about these products to help influence policy.

# CONCLUSION:

Patients using Kratom or Phenibut perceive low risks but experience dependence and withdrawal. Successful treatment of Kratom use with BNX and Phenibut with Baclofen is possible.
