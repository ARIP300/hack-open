# DISCUSSION

The results of this study show that as many as 62.5% of participants reported having anticipated and/or experienced discrimination in the work setting. Anticipated workplace discrimination was reported more often than experienced workplace discrimination. Participants from countries with a very high HDI reported significantly more often anticipated and experienced workplace discrimination, although even in the medium/low HDI group about one-third of participants reported discrimination in the work setting. Regarding the third research question, it was found that experienced workplace discrimination was indeed independently related to unemployment.

These findings show that discrimination in the workplace is a common problem in many countries worldwide. Considering that inpatients were excluded from the study, for the total group of people with MDD these percentages may even be much higher. These findings are consistent with those of a recent review.
