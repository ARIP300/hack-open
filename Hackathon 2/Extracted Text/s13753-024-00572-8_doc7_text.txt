The epistemic injustice here lies in the insufficient public communication and community understanding surrounding vaccines that were being rolled out to provide clear information and address misconceptions by providing accurate details about the purpose of vaccines. The absence of such efforts contributed to a gap in shared knowledge, potentially leading to the perpetuation of misinformation and hesitancy. Furthermore, a lack of cultural sensitivity in addressing the unique concerns of diverse communities further undermined trust and engagement in the vaccination process, reflecting an unjust denial of their right to be understood and assured in public health initiatives as reflected in the below quote:

People were not getting questions answered about the side-effects of this thing. So if you’ve had the first one [vaccines] and you’ve had a bad reaction to it and your doctor cannot explain to you what’s going on, the chances of you getting the next and the third are very low … Because the truth is, they won’t report the side-effects of it. I know a lot of people don’t talk about it, but I know people who had reached menopause and they’re now having periods again. People who have lost hair. There was one girl who after having the vaccine had to be in a cold shower to stop her body from shaking constantly. Doctors can’t answer those questions, so why would I go and get a third one?

Decision making is almost inevitably “top-down” and in the context of the pandemic response, this was the case. It highlights a centralized approach driven by elected leaders. However, the concentration of decision-making power within a small room, despite efforts to gather input from diverse sources, raises questions about the inclusivity and exclusivity of the decision-making process. The Senior government official went on to emphasize the need for engagement with various sectors, including ethnically diverse groups, to incorporate diverse perspectives:

We should include, as you asked the question, I thought of the Gypsy traveller community. The Gypsy traveller community traditionally quite vaccine sceptic, quite difficult to hear from traditionally so in order to get to them, you need to speak to the community leaders who can help with that. So how are we going to communicate? Which trusted voices are we going to use because the 53-year-old White guy is probably not going to be able to engage with them. So we did that and we did that with the African Caribbean community. We did it with young people. We did it with older people. So we tried our best because if you’re the national [XX] director, there’s only one of me so you can’t have every ethnicity represented in the one individual. So my job is to try and hear from those voices as much as I can, take those voices and give that advice to the First Minister. (Senior government official)

# 5.4 Unfair Denial of Knowledge

The fourth condition of epistemic injustice entails the exclusion of a knowledgeable individual from a decision-making process that inevitably affects him/her; s/he experiences discrimination as a knower. For example, the absence of diverse representation in decision-making bodies overseeing the Covid-19 vaccine policy risks formulating policies without taking into account specific communities’ distinctive needs and apprehensions, thereby reinforcing the unfair denial of their rights as integral stakeholders in shaping healthcare strategies. This is typical of many public health decisions. A senior Scottish government official explained how decisions regarding Covid-19 were made:
