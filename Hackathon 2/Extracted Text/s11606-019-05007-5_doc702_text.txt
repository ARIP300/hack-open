# ABSTRACTS

# DESCRIPTION:

Prior to the VDT® experience preclinical students documented a management plan for an 86-year-old with dementia presenting with uncontrolled hypertension. Following the 8-minute VDT® simulation, students submitted a reflection on their experience and were allowed to modify their original plan. Qualitative research methods using grounded theory were used to gain insights from student comments on recognition of the multidimensional nature of the problem and the effect on their treatment plans.

# EVALUATION:

Of the 117 students who experienced the VDT®, 101 completed the assignment. Pre VDT® Prior to the experience 60% of students focused on pharmacologic management, 28% addressed care-giver issues.

# VDT® reflections

Common themes and sample statements identified in the reflections included:

- Emotional/physical discomfort: "The biggest challenge was hearing/interpreting/communicating with others. The sensory overload is something that I will never forget" "It's scary. Even the temporary experience was unbearable…" "Feeling rushed by others, feeling abandoned, a large sense of frustration, … I was unable to make sense of what was around me"
- Experience of challenges faced by patient: Dementia is much more than just memory loss "… gave the unique insight as far as how a person with dementia experiences problems"
- Empathy: "I could understand better if someone with dementia reacted with anger or frustration or exhaustion knowing that they deal with this every day"
- Modification of communication behaviors: "I would take extra time to address their frustrations. Give more time and support. Check for understanding. Provide written and verbal instructions."
- Insight: "I always isolated dementia from other sensory modalities of the body. I did not understand the extent of emotional changes the patient goes through on a day to day basis."

Post VDT A majority of students amended their original plans to include various non-pharmacologic strategies such as caregiver assistance (33%), assistive devices and environmental modifications (33%).

# DISCUSSION / REFLECTION / LESSONS LEARNED:

The VDT® simulation resulted in increased empathy and insight into the struggles faced by patients with dementia as evidenced by the reflections noted by the preclinical students. Additionally, it resulted in a modification of their management plans to include consideration of home environment and assistance requirements.

# DON'T WAIT, ESCALATE!: IMPROVING RESIDENT PERCEIVED ESCALATION BARRIERS THROUGH A COMPREHENSIVE CURRICULUM

# NEEDS AND OBJECTIVES:

Residents often fail to escalate care due to uncertainty resulting in delays of care and possible harm. Multiple studies have identified trainee self-reported barriers to escalation, but none have evaluated the impact of a multi-faceted curriculum aimed to reduce perceived escalation barriers. Our objective was to identify, address, and improve residents' perceived barriers to escalation.

# SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS:

This study was conducted at an urban, academic medical center within the Internal Medicine residency program over one year.

# DESCRIPTION:

A baseline Likert-scale survey categorized residents' perceived escalation issues. A four-lecture curriculum about common causes of patient deterioration and an objective structured clinical examination (OSCE) were created to address the found issues. In the OSCE PGY1 residents first entered the room with the option to escalate to a PGY2 or a PGY3 acting as the rapid response team (RRT) leader with an attending physician creating pushback/intimidation throughout. Debrief focused on both knowledge and skills.

# NEEDS AND OBJECTIVES:

The U.S. incarcerates a greater proportion of its population than any other nation at a rate of 698 per 100,000. Those involved in the criminal-legal system have a higher burden of chronic disease and mental illness compared to the general population. During the first two weeks following release from incarceration, the mortality rate of this population is 12.7 times that of the general population, with a 129 times increased risk for drug overdose. Formerly incarcerated patients (FIPs) have unique barriers to healthcare including missed appointments, insurance lapses and difficulty obtaining prescriptions upon release. Healthcare providers often lack training on how to care for FIPs. One study found that 42% of formerly incarcerated men experienced discrimination by healthcare workers. It is important for healthcare providers to be equipped to address the unique needs of FIPs in a sensitive manner.

# SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS:

This work is anchored in partnership between Massachusetts General Hospital's Crimson Care Collaborative-Nashua Street Jail (CCC-NSJ) and the Suffolk County Sheriff's Department (SCSD). CCC-NSJ is a student-faculty clinic located in a local jail where faculty from MGH teach health professions students in the correctional setting. Through a grant from the Massachusetts Medical Society Charitable Foundation, we have utilized our network of MGH faculty, CCC-NSJ volunteers, and SCSD staff to establish curricula for community clinics to improve the quality of care provided to FIPs.
