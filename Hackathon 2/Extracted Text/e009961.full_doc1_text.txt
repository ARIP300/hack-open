employees, customers or themselves, or behave in a strange and unpredictable manner, and that there is potential for symptom relapse. In addition, the anticipation of discrimination by people with MDD may lead them not to apply for a job, in the expectation of failure or rejection.

Whereas most studies on mental health problems and discrimination in the workplace have focused on severe mental disorders such as schizophrenia, relatively few have focused on major depressive disorder (MDD). This is remarkable, as MDD is one of the leading causes of the global burden of disease. It is one of the most prevalent of all causes of disability and therefore an important public health problem. Across different countries and cultures, stigma and discrimination form an important barrier to work reintegration, although this topic has hardly been studied. In this context, the aim of this study was to assess: (1) if people with MDD of working age anticipate and experience discrimination because of their mental health problems when trying to find or keep paid employment; (2) if people with MDD of working age from high, middle and lower developed countries differ in this respect; and (3) if discrimination experiences when trying to find or keep paid employment are related to present work status (ie, having a paid job) in working aged people with MDD.

Students (N=72) and retired respondents (N=168) were excluded from the analyses. Full details of the method have been published previously.

# METHODS

# Study design

Data were gathered as part of a larger study by the European Commission-funded Anti Stigma Programme European Network (ASPEN) study and the International Study of Discrimination and Stigma for Depression (INDIGO) research network. In a cross-sectional survey, people with a clinical diagnosis of major depressive disorder were interviewed in 35 countries. The ASPEN countries included Belgium, Bulgaria, England, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Portugal, Romania, Scotland, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain and Turkey. The countries participating through the INDIGO network included Australia, Brazil, Canada, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Egypt, India, Japan, Malaysia, Morocco, Nigeria, Pakistan, Serbia, Sri Lanka, Taiwan, Tunisia and Venezuela.

The design of this study was intentionally pragmatic so that as many as possible low income and middle income countries could participate using only locally available resources, because no external funding was available. Participants were recruited through local research staff who were asked to identify people attending specialist mental health services (either outpatient or day care in the public and private sectors) in the local area with a clinical diagnosis of MDD in the previous 12 months. All were asked to apply the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) criteria in the same traditional way. Within centres, site directors were asked to identify a minimum of 25 participants who were, in their judgement, reasonably representative (as a group) of all people with a diagnosis of MDD attending specialist mental health services.

# Procedure

Data were gathered during face-to-face interviews in 2010, between 1 January and 31 December. Inclusion criteria were (1) a clinical diagnosis of major depressive disorder during the previous 12 months (single episode or recurrent), as based on the DSM-IV criteria; (2) ability to speak and understand the main local language; and (3) aged 18 years or older. Individuals who were receiving psychiatric inpatient care during recruitment were excluded. The study was approved by the appropriate ethical review board at each study site. After complete description of the study to the subjects, written informed consent was obtained.

# Measures

Participants were assessed face to face by independent researchers not involved in the care process using the standardised Discrimination and Stigma scale (V.12), a structured interview for recording the discrimination experienced by an individual with a mental health problem. The DISC-12 interview starts with the statement ‘Discrimination and stigma occur when people are treated unfairly because they are seen as being different from others. This interview asks about how participants have been affected by discrimination and stigma because of mental health problems’. The instrument consists of 32 questions, assessing discrimination in several life domains, such as marriage, parenting, housing and leisure. For the present paper, only the items that referred to discrimination in the work environment are reported on. For anticipated discrimination, the items used in this study were: ‘Because of how others might respond to your mental health problem, have you stopped yourself from applying for work?’ and ‘Because of how others might respond to your mental health problem, have you stopped yourself from applying for education and training?’
