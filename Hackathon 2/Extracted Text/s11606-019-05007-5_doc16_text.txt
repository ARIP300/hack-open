groups, though differences were not significant compared to BA (11%), TM (29%, p=0.13), NRT (30%, p=0.07), and TM+NRT (22%, p=0.35). Groups offered NRT by mail were more likely to report NRT use compared to BA (51%), TM (63%, p=0.47), NRT (82%, p=0.011), and TM+NRT (76%, p=0.049). There was no difference in days of NRT use over the first 2 weeks between NRT only (4.6 days of NRT use) or NRT+TM (3.0 days, p=0.13).

# CONCLUSIONS:

This pilot RCT demonstrated feasibility as we recruited, treated, and retained smokers from a primary care network. Our uptake of 15% is comparable to other proactive outreach interventions for smokers. A proactive offer to have NRT mailed to patients' homes increased NRT use, even though many patients already had access to low-cost NRT from Medicaid. Adherence messages in the texting program did not increase NRT use. Proactively-delivered smoking cessation interventions that are offered outside office visits are feasible and hold promise for reducing smoking rates and promoting health in primary care populations.

assumed by patient team members, with patient contributions that move from responsive to proactive.

# CONCLUSIONS:

Patient and staff team member views of a patient's role in innovation teams drive the ways team members interact and the ways patients contribute to team work. Patient evolution requires conscious aim and willingness among all team members to set expectations and support progressive advancement of patients in the overall work of the team.

# A QUALITATIVE STUDY OF PATIENTS WHO OVERDOSED IN THE CURRENT ENVIRONMENT OF RESTRICTIVE OPIOID PRESCRIBING POLICIES

# BACKGROUND:

Faced with the growing opioid overdose epidemic, government agencies, health systems and medical providers have developed and implemented laws and policies to reduce opioid prescribing and expand access to naloxone and substance use disorder treatment. Despite these efforts to reduce overdose risk and improve pain management, overdoses continue to occur at an unprecedented rate. The reasons for this persistently elevated rate remain unclear. We conducted a qualitative study of patients who experienced an overdose and their family members to better understand the factors that led to an overdose in this current environment.

# METHODS:

We conducted semi-structured interviews with patients from a large integrated care organization in Colorado who experienced an opioid overdose in 2017 or 2018. Patients were identified using ICD codes for overdose and medical charts were reviewed to confirm the overdose. Patients were recruited and asked to invite family members who were present at the time of the overdose to participate in the interview. Interviews explored patients' history of pain, perceived risks and benefits of opioids, circumstances that led to the overdose and actions taken in response to the overdose. A constant comparative method of inductive and deductive analysis was used to code transcribed interviews and generate themes.

# RESULTS:

We enrolled 9 patients who experienced an opioid overdose, 8 of which involved a pharmaceutical opioid. Five patients were female and mean age was 46.1 years (range 22-65). Three family members of participants also enrolled. We identified 3 themes: The first theme was process failure - It appears as though some policies had limited reach. No patients or family members had picked up naloxone, nor were any patients in treatment for substance use disorder. The second theme was low risk perception - Prior to experiencing the event, patients did not believe they were at increased risk and thought only patients who were using medications to "get high" were at risk. The third theme was increased pain leading to risky behaviors - Patients felt providers reduced opioid dose in response to prescribing policies. These dose reductions led to increased pain and feelings of powerlessness and desperation. To find relief, they took more opioids than prescribed or in combination with other medications and substances, leading to overdose.

# CONCLUSIONS:

In this qualitative study, we identified 3 major themes related to overdose risk. Our findings suggest that the reach of some preventive interventions, such as naloxone, are limited. Additionally, while these policies have significantly reduced opioid prescribing across the United States, they may also have unintended consequences. Further research should examine the adverse outcomes of these policies at a population level.
