# Adekola and Chia. Stakeholder Theory, Public Engagement, and Epistemic Injustice

Variations in vaccine hesitancy across different ethnic demographics, suggesting a need for further examination in the context of Scotland. Several barriers to vaccine uptake have been highlighted in extant literature. Misinformation and disinformation, racism, historical trauma, mistrust, and systemic inequities are argued to shape hesitancy to vaccines, specifically in ACB communities (Momplaisir et al. 2021; Nephew 2021; Razai et al. 2021; Savoia et al. 2021; Adekola et al. 2022). For example, Zimmerman et al. (2023) argued that misinformation and disinformation spread primarily through social media significantly impact vaccine hesitancy. False claims about vaccine safety, efficacy, or side effects often lead to apprehension among individuals who come across such information (Adekola et al. 2022). Furthermore, historical instances of medical exploitation and unethical experimentation (e.g. the Tuskegee Syphilis Study), have left a lingering legacy of mistrust within ACB communities (Hou et al. 2024) and added to scepticism about the intentions behind public health initiatives, including vaccination campaigns. The Tuskegee Syphilis Study, spanning 1932 to 1972, was an unethical medical research project by the US Public Health Service. With 400 African American men as subjects, the participants were never informed of their syphilis diagnosis, and treatment was intentionally withheld even after the advent of penicillin (Brandt 1978).

# 2 Stakeholder Theory and Public Policy Making and Implementation

Traditional shareholder theory emphasizes maximizing shareholder value as the main objective of a business or governance (O’Connell and Ward 2020). Proponents, such as Freeman and Reed (1983), criticized shareholder theory for its narrow view and argued that businesses should consider the interests of various stakeholders, not just shareholders, recognizing the broader impact of organizational activities on the communities and societies in which they operate. Freeman (2010) argued that stakeholders are critical to the organization’s success, not just external entities to be managed. The stakeholder theory argues that ethical considerations should extend beyond financial performance to include the impacts on employees, communities, and the environment (Freeman and Moutchnik 2013). This broader ethical stance challenged the moral neutrality of shareholder primacy, explaining that organizations are responsible to shareholders and society and have environmental obligations. The argument was reinforced by changes in laws and regulations in the 2000s that required companies to disclose more information about their social and environmental impacts (Weil et al. 2006) and to promote transparency and accountability to stakeholders. Furthermore, the rise of digital and social media platforms shifted the argument toward the importance of transparent and authentic communication with stakeholders (Sedereviciute and Valentini 2011). Organizations were urged to engage with stakeholders in real-time, responding to their concerns and building trust through open and multiple channels of communication.

Within the public sector, stakeholder engagement is widely used to enhance deliberative policy conversations (Wynne 2006; Jones and Wells 2007). Cass (2006) defined “engagement” as the formal processes that include members and stakeholders in decision making and in facilitating gathering or integrating their perspectives. These decisions may pertain to agenda setting, policy framing, or policy development. Rowe and Frewer (2005) emphasized that the success of public engagement hinges on the extent to which comprehensive and pertinent information is sought from all relevant sources, transmitted to all appropriate recipients, and decoded when necessary. However, this depends on fostering capabilities to ensure that all participants possess the skills, tools, and knowledge necessary to engage effectively.
