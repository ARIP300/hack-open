To provide a framework for characterizing diagnostic errors, we used two previously published taxonomies Diagnosis Error Evaluation and Research (DEER) and Reliable Diagnosis Challenges (RDC). We performed an iterative thematic content analysis to derive both general and disease-specific diagnostic pitfalls. From qualitative review of these pitfalls, we created a taxonomy of generic types of pitfalls and then classified pitfalls from each case into one or more of these categories.

# RESULTS:

We identified a total of 549 diagnostic pitfalls. The most common diagnoses for which diagnostic errors and pitfalls were identified included cancer (n=186): colon (46) lung (43), prostate (34), breast (33), thyroid (7), melanoma (6), bladder (5), liver (5), Hodgkin's (4), renal (3); followed by other diagnoses: myocardial infarction (29), sepsis (16), stroke (16), pulmonary embolism (11), appendicitis (4), chronic heart failure (4), diabetes mellitus (4), disk herniation (3). Analysis of the top 10 diagnosis' pitfalls (n=241) included: failures in follow-up (28%), limitations of test or exam not appreciated (26%), disease A mistaken for disease B (24%), risk factors not adequately appreciated (16%), atypical presentation (15%), counter-diagnosis cues overlooked (10%), communication failures between primary care and specialists (7%), urgency not fully appreciated (3%), chronic disease presumed to account for new symptoms (2%), evolving symptoms not monitored (2%).

# CONCLUSIONS:

Diagnostic pitfalls is a new and useful construct to identify disease-specific pitfalls from diagnostic error cases. Analysis identified generic types of pitfalls and a taxonomy to categorize them, thus revealing the relative frequency of certain types of pitfalls. This work can serve as the basis for heightening situational awareness (e.g. interventions to detect and warn clinicians of pitfall situations) and building additional cognitive safety nets to prevent harm from falling into these traps.

# BACKGROUND:

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is an important cause of morbidity and mortality around the world. Estimates show that in 2030 COPD will become the third leading cause of death worldwide. Additionally heart failure is a disease of great morbidity and mortality whose presence is estimated to increase by 46% from 2012 to 2030. Whether left ventricular diastolic dysfunction (LVDD) is a comorbidity in patients with COPD varies widely in literature. The association between DD and COPD is an important one to know given that dyspnea is a complaint shared between both illnesses. The objective of this meta-analysis was to determine if the prevalence of the diastolic dysfunction is increased in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients as evidenced by echocardiographic parameters.

# METHODS:

We used a time-and-language-restricted search strategy to identify 4912 studies. 4905 were excluded, and we did a systematic review and meta-analysis of the seven remaining case control studies conducted to compare echocardiographic parameters to diagnose diastolic dysfunction in patients with COPD and controls.

# RESULTS:

A total of 7 studies with 764 subjects were included. The total of 4905 articles were excluded based on not meeting our inclusion criteria, case control studies performed after the year 2000. Duplicates were excluded. Eighteen studies meeting the inclusion criteria were reviewed in full; 9 articles were removed due to not clearly stating the findings, and two studies were removed because the results for their control groups were unclear. Therefore, a total of 7 studies were included (n=764). Our study found the prevalence of diastolic dysfunction was higher among COPD subjects versus control group patients (OR; 1.446, C.I: 1.063-1.829, Z: 7.399; p: 0.000). The heterogeneity observed for the pooled analysis was Q-value; 17.855 df (Q); 5 P-value: 0.003, I-squared; 71.997; Tau2; 0.699, suggesting appropriate study selection and moderate heterogeneity. There were no differences in left ventricular ejection fraction.

# CONCLUSIONS:

Patients with COPD are more likely to have echocardiographic parameters of diastolic dysfunction. The diastolic dysfunction in this population, based on our data, is likely due to lung hyperinflation, chronic hypoxia, and ventricular interdependence: ventricular remodeling and deviation of the interventricular septum towards the left ventricle. Our study confirms the association between DD and COPD and sheds light that new treatment strategies that focus on preventing further cardiac dysfunction may improve mortality in COPD. Thus, more studies are needed to ascertain the effect of the treatment of COPD for the prevention of DD, a growing health burden.

# BACKGROUND:

To understand the prescribing behaviors of primary care physicians it is necessary to identify their newly initiated prescriptions. While several studies invoke the concept of an initial prescription, definitions vary, and no standard criteria have been defined. As part of a multi-institutional study to understand variation in conservative prescribing practices, we explored and developed approaches to defining and identifying newly initiated prescriptions, attempting to account for various potential sources of error.

# METHODS:

We studied EMR prescription data from all PCPs (N=60) at University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) and a sample (N=23) from Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH) ordered in 2016-2017. After excluding refills, we identified the first patient-prescription occurrence during the study period. Data for the preceding two-year period was then reviewed to identify any prior prescriptions. We then sought to identify additional issues that could result in erroneously labelling a prescription as "new."

# RESULTS:

Of 65,114 prescriptions written by PCPs at BWH, 29,647 (46%) were identified as newly initiated, while 79,419/161,062 (49%) were newly initiated at UIC. Reviewing the data we identified three additional issues needing to be refined in the algorithm to accurately classify a new prescription: (i) excluding patient-reported prior medications, (ii) accounting for first-time visits, where pre-existing drugs may be misinterpreted as new, and (iii) how to handle drugs (e.g. selected antibiotics) with primarily acute indications that should be considered new even though their record had evidence of prior prescriptions. For issue (iii), a review of prescription data for 19 medications (12,808 total prescriptions) with both acute and chronic indications, showed that 7 were prescribed acutely >80% of the time at both institutions, suggesting that prescriptions for these drugs can generally be considered new, while
