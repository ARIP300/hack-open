# Fungal Hyphae and Subcutaneous Emphysema

Fungal hyphae, fibrin, and mucus in an established lung parenchymal cavity. It has a predilection to occur in patients with COPD with history of a cavitary lesion due to tuberculosis, sarcoidosis, or necrotizing infections. Rarely does an aspergilloma progress to invasive aspergillosis. Here, we presented a case of an aspergilloma within a previous pulmonary cavity that caused a cavitary-subcutaneous fistula in the setting of excessive cough resulting in massive chest wall subcutaneous emphysema.

# CONCLUSION:

This shows pulmonary aspergilloma could rarely invade the chest wall without evidence of invasive aspergillosis, and sheds light on subcutaneous emphysema as a potential rare complication of aspergillomas without prior trauma.

# LEARNING OBJECTIVE #1:

Early recognition of pregnancy and initiation of dialysis in ESRD

# LEARNING OBJECTIVE #2:

Optimal dialysis modality & regimen

# CASE:

34-year-old female with uncontrolled DM-1 diagnosed at 12, complicated with nephropathy, retinopathy, neuropathy, neurogenic bladder, gastroparesis, on insulin pump. With 2 prior abortions and a stillbirth. Her CKD progressed from stage 4 to stage 5 after the stillbirth and AV fistula was created. Subsequently she was found to be 8 weeks pregnant on Sonogram. Her BUN was in range of 33-47 mg/dL during first few weeks of her pregnancy. Maintenance hemodialysis was initiated thrice/week for one week (13 hours total). It was subsequently switched to 6 days/week to avoid hemodynamic instability and to maintain steady biochemical profile. She got 122 sessions in total avg. duration 2.5 hrs. Her BP was controlled with MDopa. Glucose was optimized with Insulin pump. Her anemia was managed with IV iron and subsequently with EPO. She received folic acid and Vit D. Predialysis BUN was maintained at &lt;30 mg/dL &amp; Cr &lt;4 mg/dL. At 31 weeks patient underwent elective C-section due to polyhydramnios. She delivered a live, healthy 5lb baby with Apgar score of 8 and 9 at 1 &amp; 5 min. Both mother and baby did well during the follow up period.

# IMPACT/DISCUSSION:

The incidence of pregnancy in women on chronic dialysis is 1-7% (3). Evidence shows better obstetrical outcomes if women start dialysis after conceiving as compared to getting pregnant while on treatments. Preferred dialysis regimen entails increments in frequency and duration of treatment (5). Shorter and frequent HD was chosen in light of successfully using similar strategy with other cases in past. This resulted in a good maternal and fetal outcome even though CKD had progressed.

# CONCLUSION:

No clear superiority of different modalities of dialysis has been established as long as the objective of optimizing the blood chemistry is achieved without drastic changes in fluid shift and balance (5, 8, 10). Patients require frequent and close monitoring with prompt optimization of maternal BP, Hb, glucose and chemistries using dialysis along with medications management to ensure successful outcome (3). More over pregnancy outcomes are likely to be more favorable in women who start dialysis after conception (12).

# Sugar, Sugar How You Get So Low: Insulinoma, A Case Report

Julia E. Girdler; Sienna Kurland; Alicia Cowley. New York University, New York, NY. (Control ID #3170152)

# LEARNING OBJECTIVE #1:

Recognize the broad differential for hypoglycemia

# LEARNING OBJECTIVE #2:

Diagnose an insulinoma

# CASE:

A 33-year-old male with no significant past medical history was admitted after being found unconscious at his desk with a blood glucose of 28 mg/dL. He reported multiple episodes of confusion, slurred speech, and unsteady gait in the context of fasting that was relieved with meals. He reported almost a decade of high sugar intake - consuming 1.5L of soda and multiple candy bars daily - to prevent lightheadedness. He denied medication or drug use. On admission, he was hemodynamically stable with an unremarkable physical exam. Laboratory values were significant for glucose of 156 mg/dL and then 34 mg/dL after a 5-hour fast. Further work-up revealed insulin of 21 uIU/mL, c-peptide of 2.4 ng/mL (RR 0.8- 3.5), B-hydroxybutyric acid &lt;0.2 mmol/L, hemoglobin A1c of 4.3%, a negative sulfonylurea panel, insulin antibody, toxicology screen, and ethanol level, normal thyroid stimulating hormone, liver function tests, and complete blood count, and borderline-normal ACTH stimulation test. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a hyper-enhancing mass in the head of the pancreas. He underwent local resection and enucleation of the mass; pathology confirmed an insulinoma.

# IMPACT/DISCUSSION:

Insulinomas are rare neuroendocrine tumors that classically present with Whipple's Triad: neuroglycopenic symptoms, hypoglycemia, and rapid resolution of symptoms with glucose. Due to their rarity, a broad differential diagnosis for hypoglycemia should be considered first. This includes sepsis, starvation, alcohol-induced hypoglycemia, adrenal insufficiency, hepatic and renal failure. Hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia narrows the differential to autoimmune hypoglycemia, exogenous insulin injection, secretagogue ingestion, and insulinoma. Anti-insulin antibody and sulfonylurea panel further narrow the differential. Patients with a suspected insulinoma should undergo a supervised fast with serum levels of insulin, c-peptide, and B-hydroxybutyrate drawn once glucose levels reach &lt;50 mg/dl for optimal specificity and sensitivity. An insulinoma is suggested by elevated insulin (&gt;3 uIU/mL) and c-peptide (&gt;0.6 ng/mL) plus low B-hydroxybutyrate (&lt;2.7 mmol/L). Localization of the tumor is done with computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, or endoscopic ultrasound, which has the highest sensitivity and specificity for insulinoma. A selective arterial calcium stimulation test can also aid in localization. The majority of insulinomas are benign and can be surgically resected.

# CONCLUSION:

When a patient presents with Whipple's triad, the key to diagnosis is thorough history taking, observation, and diagnostic testing. Essential questions include timing of symptoms, comorbidities, medications, and social history. During a supervised fast, inappropriately elevated levels of insulin and c-peptide with low B-hydroxybutyrate establish the diagnosis of insulinoma. Once imaging confirms the diagnosis, benign solitary insulinomas can be surgically resected.
