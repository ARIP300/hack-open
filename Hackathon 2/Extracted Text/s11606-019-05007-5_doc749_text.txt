# Reflective Practice in Internal Medicine Residency

DESCRIPTION: It is imperative to address professional identity development and resiliency during residency training. However, the challenges to implementation are ever-increasing with productivity demands on clinician-educators. Over one academic year in this IM residency, reflective practice groups held 2-hour sessions every 10 weeks during duty hours. Sessions were mandatory, and residents had no clinical responsibilities during this time. Reflective practice groups followed a curriculum for one year, using several tools for creating a safe environment that fostered camaraderie and dedicated time to introspection and shared reflections between faculty and trainees.

EVALUATION: Residents and faculty surveys on the effectiveness of the reflective practice sessions were administered at the 12- and 20-month mark after implementation of the curriculum. The response rate was 60% overall. Results include the perceived value of sessions (quantitative ratings and qualitative feedback), and topics that the residents found to be most beneficial or would like added. Data includes ratings of attitudes regarding the helpfulness of this curriculum.

DISCUSSION / REFLECTION / LESSONS LEARNED: Reflective practice helped guide residents and physicians in this residency program to become more aware of their personal context, biases and reactions while addressing significant topics such as providing equitable care. It also addressed personal feelings of physician burnout and fatigue, as well as how to continue fostering joy and meaning in medicine. Data after one year revealed that medicine residents surveyed rated compassion fatigue, resilience, mistakes and guilt/shame as the most important topics, and the majority would choose to continue the reflective practice curriculum.

# SURVEY OF LEADERS OF U.S. PRIMARY CARE INTERNAL MEDICINE TRAINING PROGRAMS: EXPLORING GRADUATE CAREER PURSUITS

NEEDS AND OBJECTIVES: There is a critical shortage of primary care physicians in the United States. To address this need, specialized Primary Care Internal Medicine (PC IM) residency programs provide dedicated training in ambulatory medicine. Literature assessing the ultimate career pursuits of PC IM graduates is limited. We aimed to explore the career choices of PC IM graduates and to identify program features that were associated with more graduates remaining in General Internal Medicine (GIM).

SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: We conducted a cross sectional survey of Program Leaders of PC IM training programs or tracks in the United States.

DESCRIPTION: We identified PC IM programs via the National Resident Matching Program, the American Medical Association's Fellowship and Residency Electronic Interactive Database, and individual program websites. Forty-five of the 70 programs identified as PC IM training programs or tracks completed the survey (64% response rate).

EVALUATION: Program leaders report that 55.8% of graduates within the last 5 years pursued PC or GIM careers, 23.1% pursued subspecialty fellowship training (i.e. cardiology) and 10.3% pursued primary-care oriented fellowship (i.e. geriatrics). Amount of training time in ambulatory settings, but not the number of continuity clinic sessions, was mildly associated with PC IM graduate career choices. Less ambulatory time was associated with more graduates pursuing subspecialty fellowship training (correlation coefficient -0.38, p value 0.02). There was no significant association between careers in PC or GIM and program size, age of program, number of continuity clinic sessions, number of continuity clinic sites, number of patient visits per continuity clinic session, breadth of subspecialty ambulatory rotations required or widely available, or breadth of topics included in PC curriculum.

DISCUSSION / REFLECTION / LESSONS LEARNED: Dedicated PC IM programs serve a critical role in addressing the shortage of primary care physicians in the U.S. We found that more than half of PC IM residents choose careers in PC or GIM. Less ambulatory time, but not less continuity clinic exposure, was associated with more graduates pursuing subspecialty fellowship training. This suggests that increasing ambulatory exposure across subspecialty clinics may be more effective at increasing the PC workforce than increasing time in continuity clinic. Future research could identify specific features of ambulatory exposure and of continuity clinics that are associated with more graduates pursuing careers in GIM.

# TEACH THE TEACHER MODEL: AN INNOVATIVE METHOD FOR DEVELOPING A POINT OF CARE ULTRASOUND CURRICULUM WITHIN A LARGE ACADEMIC INSTITUTION

NEEDS AND OBJECTIVES: Point-of-Care Ultrasound (POCUS) enhances the physical exam and is emerging as a necessary skill in modern medicine. Designing an Internal Medicine (IM) resident POCUS curriculum is difficult with limited faculty who are trained and comfortable using ultrasound. Our objective is to circumvent this obstacle and promote a cultural shift towards embracing bedside ultrasound by creating a "teach the teacher model" as the foundation of our IM POCUS curriculum.

SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: In July 2018, 105 IM residents were in need of ultrasound training and only 1 inpatient POCUS trained IM faculty was available for teaching. 25 upper level residents received early structured POCUS training from July through September to be "POCUS champions." They went on to be peer instructors alongside faculty during workshops and in the clinical setting the remainder of the year.

DESCRIPTION: Training begins with POCUS lectures on the lung, heart, and IVC followed by hands on workshops with standardized patients. POCUS champions participate in gel rounds, where they perform 25 lung, heart, and IVC exams on real patients under trained faculty supervision. They must demonstrate proficiency before training other residents. In the multiplier phase, POCUS champions become mentors for 4-5 untrained residents and are allowed to supervise exams. All untrained residents are expected to complete 25 supervised lung, heart, and IVC exams by the end of the academic year. The rising PGY2s and PGY3s with the most interest and skill are selected to be the new POCUS champions the subsequent year. The current curriculum focuses only on cardiac and pulmonary imaging. It will expand to cover other organ systems and POCUS education will be further augmented through additional training methods.

EVALUATION: A survey prior to implementing the curriculum showed that over 70% of residents felt uncomfortable or very uncomfortable performing POCUS exams. 21 of the initial 25 residents received their POCUS champion teaching privileges at the faculty's discretion. The curriculum is still in its early stages so compiled data is limited. We plan to evaluate the curriculum and resident POCUS proficiency in the following ways: 1) annual surveys to assess resident comfort; 2) tracking exams to measure POCUS use; 3) remote.
