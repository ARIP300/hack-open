# BACKGROUND

Most older adults have multimorbidity, the co-existence of multiple chronic conditions, that profoundly affect physical functioning. Physical functioning is a universal health value that strongly predicts poor health outcomes and is linked to multimorbidity in aging adults. However, it is not consistently available in administrative data. We previously developed and validated a multimorbidity index that weights self-reported physician-diagnosed diseases by physical functioning. Although the multimorbidity-weighted index (MWI) has been extensively validated, its use is currently limited to self-reported conditions. Herein, we aimed to develop an ICD-coded MWI (MWI-ICD) for use in administrative claims data and compare its performance with traditional multimorbidity metrics.

# METHODS

We linked Health and Retirement Study (HRS) and Medicare claims to develop a multimorbidity index of ICD-coded conditions (MWI-ICD) for administrative data. Medicare-eligible HRS participants with at least two outpatient claims or one inpatient claim within two years contributed repeated measures of ICD-9-Clinical Modification chronic conditions and a modified Short Form-36 10-item physical functioning scale between 2000-2012. Mixed effects models adjusted for age and all other ICD-coded chronic conditions were used to obtain regression coefficients for conditions on physical functioning. Conditions that were inversely associated with physical functioning and stably estimated were retained in the final model. MWI-ICD was calculated by summing the physical functioning-weighted conditions for each participant. We compared the distribution and performance of MWI-ICD with a simple (i.e., unweighted) disease count.

# RESULTS

We included 71,756 observations from 17,478 participants with mean age 70.3 (SD 7.2) years and 56.0 (SD 30.3) physical functioning units. We considered 409 ICD-coded chronic diseases and conditions in the initial analysis and narrowed this to 143 in the final model. Diseases varied several-fold in their impact on physical functioning (median 1.3, range 0.03-17.3). The top prevalent conditions were hypertensive disease (73%), osteoarthosis (43%), other disorders of kidney and ureter, urethra and urinary tract, and bladder (41%), and coronary atherosclerosis (36%). ALS, allergic arthritis, female genitourinary cancers, hemiplegia/paraplegia, and Parkinson disease had the greatest impact on physical functioning. The mean MWI was 14.0 (median 10.3, range 0-100.1) and mean simple disease count was 8.3 (median 6, range 0-40).

# CONCLUSIONS

ICD-coded chronic conditions from Medicare claims had wide-ranging associations with physical functioning. MWI had a wider distribution than simple disease count, suggesting that a simple disease count is unlikely to capture the full impact of multimorbidity on physical functioning. A newly-developed multimorbidity index based on ICD-coded chronic conditions is feasible and readily implemented in administrative claims data.

# BACKGROUND

Tobacco cessation is a high value intervention but clinician counseling in primary care practices is suboptimal. Our goal was to determine whether a clinical architecture intervention that includes reliable medical assistant (MA) tobacco data sent to clinicians' notes at the point of care is associated with an increase in tobacco cessation in primary care.

# METHODS

We implemented the clinical architecture intervention in one internal medicine clinic and compared outcomes to two other primary care practices in the same health care system. The clinical architecture intervention paired MA data collection on current tobacco status with a clinician "action" tool. The clinician action tool pushed MA information to the assessment and plan section of the clinician's note, acting as a prompt for the clinician during the visit. The action tool had a drop-down menu with documentation for 1) tobacco cessation addressed and plan description 2) tobacco use not addressed, and 3) "wildcard" so that clinicians could provide their own documentation. Using electronic health record data, we identified patients who had an index visit within the practices from 4/2017 to 4/2018 and who reported tobacco use. We compared self-reported tobacco use for these patients at follow up visits between 90 -179 days and 180 to 359 days from the index visit in intervention and control practices. Propensity score matching (on age, gender, zip code, and duration of follow-up) was used to match patients at the intervention practice to comparable patients in the two control practices. Logistic regression was used to estimate the association between the intervention and tobacco use at the first follow-up visit (90-179 days) and the second follow-up visit (180-360 days). A difference in differences specification was used to control for temporal trends. Standard errors were clustered at the provider level.

# RESULTS

We identified 538 patients that used tobacco at the index visit in the intervention practice and 1,647 tobacco users in the control practices. One hundred sixty-six patients (31%) in the intervention and 500 patients (31%) in the control practices had a first follow up visit. For the second follow up visit, 142 (26%) and 388 (24%) patients had a follow up visit in the intervention and control practices, respectively. The intervention was associated with a 10% (p=0.006) reduction in tobacco use at the first follow-up visit and a 6% reduction at the second follow-up visit (p=0.121).

# CONCLUSIONS

Our clinical architecture intervention was associated with a statistically significant reduction in reported tobacco use at the first follow-up visit. A reduction, although not quite significant, was also observed at the second follow-up visit. Having actionable tobacco data for clinicians within the assessment and plan at the point of care may help to facilitate tobacco cessation for primary care patients.
