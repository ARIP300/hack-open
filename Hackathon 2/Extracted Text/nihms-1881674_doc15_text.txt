Among individuals with an active SUD, exposure to workplace social norms supporting substance use may trigger craving and substance use. Workplace norms may create an aura of acceptability and normality supporting an individual’s substance use. Such workplace norms may undermine motivation to initiate unassisted or assisted attempts to quit or control one’s substance use. Among individuals in recovery from a SUD, exposure to workplace norms supporting substance use may trigger cravings that lead to a recurrence of substance use and the SUD.

Based on ritual theory (Collins, 2004), after‑work alcohol use among coworkers can be viewed as a lifestyle ritual that signals the transition from work to leisure, marks the social boundary of inclusion or exclusion of coworkers in one’s after‑work social group, and strengthens social identities and bonds among group members. Instrumentalization theory (Muller, 2020; Muller & Schumann, 2011) also suggests that after‑work drinking rituals involve two substance‑related motivational goals—self‑medication to enable the transition from a stressful workday to leisure and the desire to improve social interactions.

A qualitative study by Buvik (2020) found that participants viewed after‑work drinking with coworkers as a way of unwinding and disengaging from the demands and stresses of the workday and marking the transition to nonwork or leisure. Also, participants emphasized how after‑work drinking could build camaraderie and cohesion among coworkers and served as a means of enhancing teambuilding. Although participating in after‑work drinking was seen as having positive outcomes for coworkers and the work environment, Buvik (2020) noted that “a work environment with high alcohol consumption can be challenging for those who refrain from drinking alcohol” (p. 4). In Buvik’s (2020) study, participants reported that failing to participate in after‑work drinking could be viewed as a rejection of coworkers resulting in exclusion from after‑work and workplace social life. Such social exclusion could pressure individuals to join after‑work drinking groups, thereby interfering with the initiation of recovery efforts among those with an active SUD and could trigger craving and the recurrence of drinking among those in recovery from a SUD. Social exclusion also may undermine the social recovery capital needed for broader recovery efforts and the emotional and social well‑being that make up SUD recovery.

Although Buvik’s (2020) qualitative observations regarding ritualistic alcohol use have potential implications for employee SUD recovery, it is important to understand that the ritualistic use of alcohol on and off the job to socialize new workers, build solidarity and camaraderie among coworkers, sanction those who do not participate through social exclusion, and the potential of ritualistic drinking to increase the risk of alcohol use disorders and undermine recovery has been documented since the early 19th century. For an intriguing review of this issue and a qualitative study on the evolution of New York City tunnel worker’s (also known as sandhogs) intemperate drinking culture to a temperate or sober drinking culture, see Sonnenstuhl (1996).
