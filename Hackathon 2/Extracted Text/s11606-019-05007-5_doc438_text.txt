# ABSTRACTS

of a nutritional drink unable to eat solid food. A couple months later, after reinstating Medicaid, she returned to the emergency department with similar symptoms. She was restaged, including laparoscopy, and esophageal stent was placed. Two weeks later additional imaging was requested in clinic. A month later, homeless and uninsured, she returned to the hospital. After her clinic appointment, she expected her chemotherapy to begin during hospitalization. CT scan of the chest showed numerous sclerotic foci throughout her vertebra. She was diagnosed with metastatic disease and was discharged to a nursing home with hospice care.

# IMPACT/DISCUSSION:

Her physicians, abiding by the "rule of rescue", ensured her cancer was diagnosed, staged and a treatment plan was formulated. Completing this work up as an inpatient was costlier than outpatient. A more constructive way of advocating is by working on resolving the barriers that result in an inability to access. Physicians cannot eliminate all barriers, mental health or homelessness, but adjusting the health care system for timely access would be less costly and effectively "rescue" patients.

# CONCLUSION:

This case is an example of inequity and a complicated wasteful health care system. A health care system in the Bronx created transition clinics for patients post-incarceration to prevent lack of health care after release. Prompt follow up would have prevented multiple hospitalizations and set up an easier path for her to follow. It is shown that much like in this case, treatment received during incarceration loses effect after release since patients are unable to receive continuous health care. Invasive diagnostic procedures directed by advocating physicians led to a treatment plan that never begun. It is our duty as physicians to not only advocate when patients are under our care but assist in creating policies for improved health care access. This patient had curable cancer with a clear treatment plan but ended up with a terminal illness because of a failing system.

# FROM ORATOR TO NON-VERBAL: A RARE CASE OF COGNITIVE DECLINE

# LEARNING OBJECTIVE #1:

Recognize Hashimoto's Encephalopathy (HE) as a differential in patients cognitive function decline

# LEARNING OBJECTIVE #2:

Recognize need for urgent steroid treatment to prevent permanent cognitive deficits

# CASE:

A 61 year old female with past medical history of hypothyroidism and sickle cell disease who presented with 4 months of progressive memory loss, weakness intermittent nausea, vomiting and extreme fatigue after eating. GI workup including EGD, colonoscopy and labs for autoimmune inflammatory hepatic conditions were negative. Infectious disease and neurology were consulted and had ruled out tick borne illness, West Nile virus and paraneoplastic syndrome when she had rapid decline in cognitive function. At baseline patient was a college professor, within 3 days of admission she was unable to follow commands, non-verbal, incontinent, hallucinating and persistently drooling. EEG was abnormal due to excessive slowing and repetitive slow sharp transients and given the differential of Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease LP was performed but CSF analysis showed no acute pathology. Due to persistent tachycardia and history of hypothyroidism, thyroid studies showed TSH 0.05, Free T4 2.82 and Free T3 7.2. Endocrinology was consulted and ordered Thyrotropin receptor Ab <1.00 and Anti-TPO Ab 869.7 leading to suspicion for HE. High dose steroids were started with rapid improvement in mental status within 24 hours and return to baseline in 3 days.

# IMPACT/DISCUSSION:

Hashimoto's Encephalopathy is a steroid responsive encephalopathy associated with autoimmune thyroiditis. It's estimated prevalence is 2:100,000 patients, with the majority being females in their 50s-60s. The underlying pathogenesis is unknown but presentation is divided into two subsets. Subacute is described as multiple remitting and relapsing episodes of mental decompensation often accompanied by seizures. Chronic is described as a slower, gradual onset of cognitive decline, confusion and hallucinations with a subset of patients having rapid decline into coma. HE remains a diagnosis of exclusion with exact diagnostic criteria not established. However, four main features are accepted; encephalopathy associated with cognitive dysfunction and psychiatric features, presence of high titer anti-TPO Ab, exclusion of neurological disease and rapid response to steroid treatment. Of note, so far there does not appear to be a link between the severity of hypothyroidism or antibody levels and severity of HE. Literature review describes a percentage of patients left with permanent cognitive deficits therefore early treatment should be encouraged. Cases of reversible dementia are likely being missed due to lack of awareness of HE. This should be on the differential for patients presenting with cognitive decline.

# CONCLUSION:

- HE is a diagnosis of exclusion - Early initiation of therapy can prevent permanent cognitive deficits. - Severity of hypothyroidism does not correlate with severity or speed of onset of HE.

# LEARNING OBJECTIVE #1:

Recognize and manage opioid overdose in a community health center setting

# LEARNING OBJECTIVE #2:

Improve linkage to effective treatment for opioid use disorder after overdose

# CASE:

A 54 yo man was found unresponsive at the door of our community health center. Rapid Response was called and the patient was found to be unresponsive to sternal rub, with 6 breaths per minute, and pinpoint pupils. One dose of 4mg of intranasal naloxone was administered, and soon the patient was alert and oriented. He declined transfer to the ED but was amenable to observation, stating that he had just purchased his usual 3 bags and used them outside of his primary care clinic. His PMH was notable for 36 years of IV/intranasal heroin use, prior stroke, GERD, glaucoma, hyperlipidemia, lumbar radiculopathy, and tobacco use. He had one overdose in the 1990s, attempted detox several times and tried self-treating himself with methadone and buprenorphine. He lived with his girlfriend and was unemployed. His medications included cyclobenzaprine and ranitidine. The medical assistant from our addiction medicine clinic engaged the patient, who reported that the overdose scared him, and offered medication treatment which he accepted. The addiction clinic nurse and physician saw the patient that day and gave an initial buprenorphine prescription, instructions and follow-up appointment. He is now stable on buprenorphine 8mg daily.

# IMPACT/DISCUSSION:

The overdose described in this case represents one of three overdoses in the past month at our NYC health center. Urban health centers often serve as community hubs and may be seen as a safer place to use opioids. Overdoses at community health centers represent an important point of patient engagement in treatment for OUD. Treatment with opioid agonist therapy after overdose has been shown to reduce all-cause and opioid-related mortality. However, only a small percentage of patients receive medication therapy after overdose. (Larochelle et al. Annals of Internal Medicine. 2018) Initiation of medication treatment for OUD at the time of ED presentation has also been shown to improve engagement in treatment. (DOnofrio et al. JAMA 2015.) Institutional commitment to training all providers and staff to recognize the signs of opioid overdose and administer intranasal naloxone has direct impact on patient outcomes. Our experience with this case has demonstrated the importance of immediate engagement in care at the time of overdose. Having a team available at the time of overdose that cares for patients with addiction enabled us to quickly engage this patient in care and start medication therapy when he felt most receptive to treatment.
