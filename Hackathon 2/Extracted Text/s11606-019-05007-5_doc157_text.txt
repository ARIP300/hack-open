prescription signature, and 7.1 days based on hospital requirements glucometer device that stores blood glucose data and reports data to patients and their primary care provider, with 24/7 on call alert phone calls from nurses - achieved the objective of reducing glycated hemoglobin among a majority low-income and racial and ethnic minority population.

METHODS: The study population included adult Medicaid beneficiaries with a prior diagnosis of type 2 diabetes who were patients of a large, urban internal medicine primary care practice. We used electronic health records data from the Mount Sinai Data Warehouse from 2013-2017. All patients received usual care that included visits with a certified diabetes educator. Given non-random participation in the intervention, we used a difference-in-difference analysis to compare within-patient changes over time in glycated hemoglobin among patients who enrolled in the intervention versus those who did not enroll, while using fixed effects to control for common time trends and time-invariant individual characteristics, such as age, sex, race/ethnicity, and baseline health status.

RESULTS: 150 and 2,593 individuals met the criteria for the treated and control groups, respectively. The overall study population had a median age of 63.60 years old, was 64.59% female, and had an average baseline glycated hemoglobin of 7.96 percent. Relative to changes over time in the control group, among the treated group glycated hemoglobin was lower by -0.50 percent (95% CI -0.69, -0.31; p < 0.001) at 6 months, -0.65 (95% CI -0.92, -0.39; p < 0.001) at 12 months, and -0.58 (95% CI -1.20, 0.09; p = 0.09) at 18 months. Males benefitted more than females. Estimated coefficients were not significantly different from zero in pre-treatment time periods, providing support for the key identifying assumption of parallel trends. Results were consistent in sensitivity analyses that constructed alternative control groups using coarsened exact matching or used patients who enrolled in the program later as controls for those who enrolled earlier.

CONCLUSIONS: Lower glycated hemoglobin was associated with a mobile technology intervention for diabetes management. An important limitation of this study is that difference-in-differences analyses rely on the untestable assumption that in the absence of the treatment, the difference between treated and the control groups would have been the same after the intervention.

# IMPLICIT BIAS AMONG HOUSESTAFF IN THE SAFETY NET: INITIAL RESULTS OF A PROSPECTIVE COHORT STUDY

BACKGROUND: Implicit bias is an important contributor to health disparities. While a robust literature describes changes in empathy during medical training, little is known about implicit biases among resident physicians during training. The goal of our study is to assess the prevalence and evolution of implicit bias over the course of graduate medical training in a safety-net hospital serving one of America's most diverse communities.

METHODS: This is a prospective cohort study of resident physicians in a safety net hospital, who participated on a voluntary basis. Participants were assigned personalized codes to ensure anonymity over serial assessments, and given a survey which assessed explicit biases, as well as attitudes towards medical school admissions and racial, financial, and other biases in healthcare. They were then asked to take Implicit Association Tests (IAT) on race and skin tone, and to report their scores anonymously using their personalized code. Fischer exact test and Kruskal-Walis test were used to analyze whether any difference existed between PGY year with IAT, explicit bias and attitude results.

RESULTS: 17 residents participated. Implicit and explicit bias differed across PGY1 and PGY3 classes with results displayed in Table 1. There was no statistically significant relationship between IAT race categories and resident characteristics.

CONCLUSIONS: Acknowledging the limits of our study, our results suggest the intriguing possibility that implicit bias falls over the course of training within a safety net environment. We plan to evaluate this hypothesis through serial assessment of individual housestaff as they move through residency.

# IMPROVEMENT IN ABDOMINAL AORTIC ANEURYSM (AAA) SCREENING IN INTERNAL MEDICINE RESIDENT VETERAN'S ADMINISTRATION CONTINUITY OF CARE CLINIC.

(Control ID #3187015)

BACKGROUND: Description of problem: The USPSTF and American Association for Vascular Surgery recommend one-time screening for AAA with ultrasonography in men ages 65 to 75 years who have ever smoked. In Iowa, 94.2% of a total 226,175 veterans are male and use the VA at a rate higher than the national average, which makes them a high priority target for AAA screening compliance. Objectives: Increase AAA screening compliance to at least 75% of eligible veterans over the course of the 2017-2018 academic year in Internal Medicine Resident Continuity of Care clinic.

METHODS: Interventions: Increase resident provider education on AAA screening recommendations through a presentation at conference and educational emails. Increase patient education regarding AAA and appropriate screening by distributing pamphlets in patient exam rooms at the primary care clinic. Measures: Current or former male smokers between the ages of 65-75 were identified from eight internal medicine patient panels at the Iowa City VA Health Care System. Screening compliance was measured as completed if abdominal duplex ultrasonography or CT scan of the abdomen identifying the aorta were performed for any reason. Data was obtained before and after the six-month quality improvement intervention. Statistical analysis was performed using N-1 chi-squared test using MedCalc statistical software.
