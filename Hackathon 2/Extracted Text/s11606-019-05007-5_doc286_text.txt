# Research on Strategies and Best Practices for Healthcare Providers to Help Older Adults Thrive During Retirement

METHODS: For this scoping review, electronic databases (PubMed; Google Scholar; PsycINFO (EBSCO); and Scopus) were searched using keyword and controlled vocabulary terms including retirement, physicians, physician-patient relationship, counseling, and guidance. No date limitations were used. English-language articles focusing on those 55 years of age and older planning to or recently leaving the labor force who were screened or counseled by their healthcare providers about how to maintain or improve their health during this transition were included. All study types were included.

RESULTS: Database searches retrieved 530 citations. One hundred ninety-six citations were for abstract review and six articles met criteria for full-text review. We found that the majority of articles focused on retirement from the medical profession or on measuring a particular intervention in the retired population. Few commented on the actual act of retirement. Importantly, no articles addressed how healthcare providers could help older adults in preparing for and moving through retirement. The few articles that did discuss the importance of addressing this transition were opinion pieces from the 1950s-1980s.

CONCLUSIONS: Surprisingly, the majority of literature focused on physician retirement, rather than on how healthcare providers can assist older adults with their retirement. There was essentially no literature evaluating strategies and best practices for healthcare providers to address the complexities of retirement and its effect on older adults' physical and mental health. Retirement, as it currently exists in the healthcare literature, is a potential untapped treasure trove of opportunities for new healthcare interventions to optimize older adults' health. This is especially critical as a large portion of the US population prepares to retire under turbulent times for social security and public and private insurance coverage. Future research can assess if and how healthcare providers approach retirement with older adults, what factors help older adults thrive in retirement, and what tools are needed for healthcare providers to use to address retirement during healthcare visits.

BACKGROUND: Mexican Americans have one of the highest prevalence of diabetes within the U.S. Hispanic community with 18.3% affected. Diabetes self-care behaviors are essential to diabetes management and often performed in the context of family support. However, few studies explore this relationship in Mexican-Americans. Our study aims to better understand how family influences diabetes self-care management in the Mexican-American community and how family is impacted by a loved oneâ€™s diagnosis of diabetes.

METHODS: We analyzed qualitative data from semi-structured interviews with Latino adults with diabetes and focus groups with adults with diabetes and their family members conducted in a predominantly Mexican-American immigrant Chicago community. Interviews and focus groups were conducted in Spanish by trained, bilingual research staff and transcribed and translated to English. Data was coded using a modified template technique using Hyperresearch.

RESULTS: Data was collected from a total of 71 participants. The majority were diagnosed with diabetes (82%), from Mexico (86%), and female (80%). Participants with diabetes described a lack of social support from family, family not knowing what it is like to live with diabetes, the negative effect of diabetes on the family relationship, and difficulty maintaining changes when with family. Many participants with diabetes had difficulty motivating family to engage in a healthy lifestyle with them ("[My family is] used to eating differently; some of them want to eat what I eat and others do not.") Even so, family was involved in day-to-day management of diabetes and provided emotional, informational, instrumental and companionship support. Suffering or death of family with diabetes and preventing diabetes in family were frequently mentioned as the main motivator to improve diabetes control. Many participants with diabetes shared information from diabetes education programs that led to positive behavioral changes in some family members. Family members noted that family responsibilities sometimes interfered with providing adequate support for their loved one with diabetes. Most family members expressed that diabetes affected their wellbeing and that of the whole family. Family members had a desire to learn more about the disease because they often did not know how to help ("You know, he's your dad and you're trying to at the same time please him but also in our culture, you respect your elders and you can't always tell them no.")

CONCLUSIONS: While lack of support and engagement from family members can undermine successful diabetes management, many participants had immediate family members available to support them. Most family members wished to learn more about how to help. Future patient education interventions with Mexican Americans with diabetes should use a culturally competent approach to educate family members on how to adopt supportive strategies to aid patients' diabetes self-management and implement behavioral changes at the family level.

# The Supportive Church Environment Score: A Novel Score to Quantify How Supportive a Church Setting is Towards Lowering CVD Risk Factors

BACKGROUND: Age-adjusted obesity prevalence and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors continue to disproportionately affect African Americans (AA). Multiple studies have shown that faith-based interventions can improve many of these factors, such as fruit and vegetable (F&V) intake. The development of a quantitative measure of the supportive health environment of churches, or the correlation of that support with church members' CVD risk behaviors have not been studied. The goal of this study was to develop and test a quantitative measure of how supportive a church's environment is towards promoting lifestyle habits that decrease CVD risk, termed the Supportive Church Environment Score (SCEC).

METHODS: Predominantly AA churches were enrolled in a 10-week faith-based cardiovascular risk reduction program led by trained lay health educators. Program participants completed a pre and post assessment inclusive of measures of CVD risk behaviors and 11 activities about the church environment. One point was assigned to each activity for a maximum score of 11. Higher scores suggest participants perceive that their church promotes CVD health activities. We evaluated the relationship between each participant's SCEC score and their daily F&V intake, physical activity, and blood pressure control. We also compared the average SCES score between churches and average F&V intake between churches.

RESULTS: At the time of this analysis 9 churches (136 participants) completed the baseline assessment. The mean age was 62.5 (SD 1.2), 80% AA, 83% women, 34% married and 97% had a high school education or higher. The mean servings of F&V were 1.7 for both. Table 1 depicts the number of participants (n) per church and average SCES. While there was a significant difference between mean SCES (p <0.001), there was no significant difference between mean daily F&V intake between churches. We found no correlation between baseline perceived individual SCEC with daily F&V intake, physical activity level or blood pressure.

CONCLUSIONS: We were able to develop a quantitative measure of health promotion activities for faith-based organizations. This early analysis of baseline data is limited by a small sample size and a pervasively.
