# 6‑month follow‑up in the number of days absent among people who use substances

Alcohol: 7.6 days vs. 0.8 days; drugs: 16.6 days vs. 5.1 days

Days tardy: Alcohol: 8.5 days vs. 0.9 days; drugs: 17.3 days vs. 1.61 days

Days unproductive: Alcohol: 20.9 days vs. 4.2 days; drugs: 43.0 days vs. 12.1 days.

Using data from the 2012 to 2014 National Survey of Drug Use and Health, Goplerud et al., (2017) reported that workers in recovery reported better annual attendance and work stability (absent: 9.5 days; more than one employer: 23%) than those with a current SUD (absent: 14.8 days; more than one employer: 36%) and similar outcomes to those in the general workforce who never had a SUD (absent: 10.5 days; more than one employer: 25%). In addition, workers in recovery reported a lower prevalence of past‑year affective disorders (serious psychological distress: 3%; anxiety disorder: 6%; depression: 7%) than those with a current SUD (serious psychological distress: 12%; anxiety disorder: 11%; depression: 11%) and similar outcomes to those in the general workforce without a SUD (serious psychological distress: 4%; anxiety disorder: 5%; depression: 6%). Although healthcare utilization was roughly equivalent across the three groups of workers, healthcare costs per employee per year were lower among workers in recovery ($1,638) than those with a current SUD ($2,197) and similar to those in the general workforce without a SUD ($1,729).

Finally, four Life in Recovery Surveys conducted in the U.S. (Laudet, 2013), Canada (McQuaid et al., 2017), UK (Best et al., 2015), and Australia (Best, 2015) assessed reported changes from active addiction to recovery on several outcomes spanning multiple life domains (e.g., family/social life, finances, health, legal, and employment). Each survey used a broad national convenience sample of adults reporting that they were (a) in recovery, (b) recovered, (c) used to have an alcohol or drug problem but no longer have a problem, or (d) were in medication‑assisted recovery. In all four studies and across all life domains, the percentage of individuals reporting positive experiences increased, and the percentage reporting negative experiences decreased during recovery compared with active addiction.

Also, across all employment and non‑employment outcomes, the increases in positive experiences and decreases in negative experiences became larger as recovery length increased.

Although the research exploring the association between SUD recovery and work outcomes is sparse, these studies provide initial evidence that recovery may be associated with substantial productivity improvements and lower healthcare costs that benefit both employees and employers. However, future research on this issue must use stronger study designs to provide more robust causal evidence for employers, including longitudinal observational studies and randomized clinical trials.

# The Impact of the Workplace on Substance Use Disorder Recovery

Despite the societal and employer consequences arising from SUDs and efforts to promote SUD recovery in the workforce, no systematic research exists on how the work environment might impact the process of SUD recovery. Therefore, in this section of the article, we present and describe a heuristic conceptual model showing how the workplace might impact.
