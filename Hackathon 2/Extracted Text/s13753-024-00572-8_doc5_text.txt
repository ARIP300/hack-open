qualitative analysis (Sandelowski 1995). A thematic analysis approach was employed, where the first author systematically reviewed, coded, and categorized the collected data into themes and subthemes (Braun and Clarke 2012). The data collected in this study have also contributed to creating the Scotland African Voices (SAV) film. The award-nominated documentary has been screened in Glasgow, Stirling, Edinburgh, Dundee, Aberdeen, and the Scottish Parliament, as well as by Public Health Scotland and the Scottish Government at the organizational level. The data analysis combined the primary data collected as part of this study with secondary data from the literature review and publicly available materials and statements from politicians and policymakers during the pandemic. Social science research increasingly relies on secondary data to tackle complex questions, especially those related to behavior at both individual and systemic levels (Davis-Kean et al. 2015). These secondary data sources also draw on various evidence and expert perspectives, providing unique insights into issues surrounding epistemic injustice.

These data point unequivocally to an unfair outcome, as it demonstrates that certain ACB communities are experiencing significantly worse health outcomes compared to the White population. In the context of epistemic injustice, it raises questions about recognizing and understanding these disparities within decision-making processes and policies related to public health. Aside from the direct health consequences, Cheshmehzangi (2022) pointed out socioeconomic disparities, including a poverty rate twice as high in the Black and other ethnic minority communities compared to the White population. This is similar to other studies that have reported structural and socioeconomic disparities within the Black and other ethnic minority communities (Lo et al. 2021; Phiri et al. 2021). In the context of pandemic response and policies, the marginalized socioeconomic status of these communities positions them in an epistemically disadvantaged stance, limiting their influence on policies.

# 5 Data and Findings: Evidence of Epistemic Injustice

# 5.1 Unfair Outcome

The first condition of epistemic injustice is situations where individuals subjected to unjustifiable discrimination as knowers not only face epistemic disadvantages, such as having their knowledge discredited or ignored but also socioeconomic inequalities stemming from this discrimination. The interplay of both epistemic and socioeconomic factors highlights the multifaceted nature of the injustices faced by individuals in this context. The disproportionate impact of Covid-19 on the ACB communities was highlighted by Public Health Scotland data with an official saying that:

At Public Health Scotland we have been monitoring the impact of the disease in minority ethnic communities very carefully ... There is definite evidence and continued evidence of increased risk for most ethnic minority groups in Scotland.

# 5.2 Unfair Judgement about Epistemic Capacity

The second condition of epistemic injustice regards unfair discrimination against an individual as a knower, and this discrimination involves biased feelings, indicating unjust judgments about the speaker’s epistemic capacity. Our data suggest a complex interplay of epistemic and specifically testimonial injustice. Testimonial injustice can be seen in the context of ACB nurses as highlighted by one of the participants in the Edinburgh discussion:

One minute we are applauding nurses, clapping for them every Thursday. And all of a sudden, the nurses that didn’t want to take the vaccine, all of a sudden [they’re losing jobs] … Just like that, overnight …
