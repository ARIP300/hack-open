# High-need, high-cost patients

STATEMENT OF PROBLEM OR QUESTION (ONE SENTENCE): High-need, high-cost patients suffer from multiple chronic medical conditions and struggle to adhere to medications and engage in self-management behaviors. Effective tools and strategies are needed to engage and activate this patient population.

OBJECTIVES OF PROGRAM/INTERVENTION (NO MORE THAN THREE OBJECTIVES): Improve adherence to medication and self-management behaviors. Improve glycemic control in diabetic patients. Achieve high patient satisfaction rates.

DESCRIPTION OF PROGRAM/INTERVENTION, INCLUDING ORGANIZATIONAL CONTEXT (E.G. INPATIENT VS. OUTPATIENT, PRACTICE OR COMMUNITY CHARACTERISTICS): Wellth is a New York-based digital health company that has developed a mobile application rooted in behavioral economic principles to help patients with chronic conditions improve their adherence to medication and self-management behaviors. Wellth's app prompts patients with daily reminders and financial incentives to motivate long-term habit formation through daily reinforcement. Patients use the app to upload photos to track their adherence to required behaviors. For this program, $75 in rewards was offered in increments of $15 paid out every two weeks as long as patients were fully adherent. For missed tasks, a deduction of up to $2 was made. The patients participating in this pilot are part of the PEAK Health Clinic at Mount Sinai Hospital, an outpatient clinic that offers intensive primary care services and complex care management to a high-need, high-cost, multimorbid, mixed Medicaid/Medicare patient population. Patients with suspected or known nonadherence were referred for enrollment by their primary care provider. Patients were ineligible if their device was incompatible with the Wellth software. Providers received weekly reports summarizing adherence rates and glucose and weight measurements. Hypo or hyperglycemia, significant weight gain, or sustained nonadherence triggered alerts to the patient's care team.

MEASURES OF SUCCESS (DISCUSS QUALITATIVE AND/OR QUANTITATIVE METRICS WHICH WILL BE USED TO EVALUATE PROGRAM/INTERVENTION): Percent adherence to medication, glucose-monitoring and weight check-in. Change in A1c pre and post intervention in diabetic patients. Change in weight pre and post intervention in CHF patients. Patient satisfaction with the intervention.

FINDINGS TO DATE (IT IS NOT SUFFICIENT TO STATE FINDINGS WILL BE DISCUSSED): We successfully enrolled 56 patients, overall they demonstrated 84% adherence to medications, 87% adherence to glucose-monitoring and 95% adherence to daily weight check-ins. Among patients with Type 1 or Type 2 Diabetes, there was an average decrease in hemoglobin A1c of 0.5%. Patients enrolled in Wellth for weight check-ins due to a history of congestive heart failure demonstrated an average decrease in weight of 3.7lbs. Patient surveys have revealed a net promoter score of 94%, indicating a high level of patient satisfaction with Wellth.

KEY LESSONS FOR DISSEMINATION (WHAT CAN OTHERS TAKE AWAY FOR IMPLEMENTATION TO THEIR PRACTICE OR COMMUNITY?): High-need, high-cost patients with multiple chronic medical conditions and suboptimal adherence can be engaged to improve adherence to medication and self-management behaviors through the use of a mobile-based intervention that incentivizes patients using behavioral economic principles. Adherence rates were above 80% for all three target behaviors, indicating a high success rate among a generally difficult to engage patient population.

# PA-HOSPITALIST TASK FORCE: USING APPRECIATIVE INQUIRY TO DRIVE POSITIVE CHANGE WITHIN A HOSPITAL MEDICINE GROUP

STATEMENT OF PROBLEM OR QUESTION (ONE SENTENCE): Burnout and provider attrition is pervasive in hospital medicine and negatively impacts physicians (MDs), physician assistants (PAs), and patient care.

OBJECTIVES OF PROGRAM/INTERVENTION (NO MORE THAN THREE OBJECTIVES): A collaborative working group, the "PA-Hospitalist Task Force," was created to formulate strategies to: 1. Provide excellent patient care 2. Improve hospitalist and PA job satisfaction and retention 3. Improve hospitalist and PA professional development.

DESCRIPTION OF PROGRAM/INTERVENTION, INCLUDING ORGANIZATIONAL CONTEXT (E.G. INPATIENT VS. OUTPATIENT, PRACTICE OR COMMUNITY CHARACTERISTICS): A PA-Hospitalist Task Force comprised of three PAs and three hospitalist physicians was created at an affiliate hospital of a major urban academic center. The Task Force used an appreciative inquiry (AI) approach, through surveys and focus groups, to elicit the strengths of the group and harness them to achieve shared goals (defined above). To discover the best of "what is," MDs and PAs were prompted to reflect upon the strengths and behaviors of colleagues in an open-ended survey. To dream "what could be," participants were asked in focus groups to envision their ideal work environment. To design "what should be," Task Force members analyzed survey responses and focus group field notes for themes that were used to develop a set of Best Practice Guidelines. To "create what will be," guidelines were distributed to the group for implementation and a series of skills development workshops ensured successful implementation of best practices.

MEASURES OF SUCCESS (DISCUSS QUALITATIVE AND/OR QUANTITATIVE METRICS WHICH WILL BE USED TO EVALUATE PROGRAM/INTERVENTION): Qualitative data was collected via two surveys that evaluated the impact of the program on patient care, job satisfaction and professional development, motivation and meaning in work, and decision to continue employment at the institution.

FINDINGS TO DATE (IT IS NOT SUFFICIENT TO STATE FINDINGS WILL BE DISCUSSED): A survey was sent out six months after the Best Practice Guidelines were disseminated. 17 MDs (74%) and 11 PAs (55%) responded. Participants noted that the new standardized handoff format improved patient care by facilitating efficient and accurate transitions of care and medication reconciliation. PA-led rounds fostered critical thinking, teaching, and improved communication between providers. PAs noted enhanced professional development through increased autonomy in clinical decision-making and communication with patients and providers. PAs and MDs noted a closer partnership in patient care and increased professional development with role optimization. PAs and MDs found enhanced meaning and motivation in work when surrounded by colleagues who drive positive change. Future areas of study include impact on patient care (HCAHP scores, length of stay), efficiency (PA clock-out times), job satisfaction (length of employment), and professional development (scholarly output).

KEY LESSONS FOR DISSEMINATION (WHAT CAN OTHERS TAKE AWAY FOR IMPLEMENTATION TO THEIR PRACTICE OR COMMUNITY?): Appreciative inquiry is a powerful tool that can be used within the healthcare setting to change culture and drive positive change. A collaborative approach can be used to optimize hospital medicine PA and MD clinical care delivery, meaning in work, and professional development, and can be translated to other fields.
