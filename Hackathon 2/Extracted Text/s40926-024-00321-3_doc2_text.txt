# Freedom In Anderson And Smith

Smith (1759, 1776) and Anderson (2017) provide a specific and useful lens into the broad issue of the meaning of work that scholars have addressed in diverse commercial contexts. Scholars have, for instance, examined the nature, meaning, and value of work (see Cholbi 2022) and workplace democracy (González-Ricoy 2014); whether workplace democracy is sufficient or merely necessary (Breen 2015) for republican freedom; whether capitalism (Brennan 2014) or socialism (O’Shea 2020) better secures republican freedom and overall freedom; and whether republican freedom is more than merely an absence of domination (Coffee 2015). But perhaps no one has surpassed Smith’s illuminating account (1759) of how workers form sentiments and how this contributes to their flourishing or languishing—a contribution largely ignored by recent scholarship.4

Anderson’s (2017) contribution to this discussion is to argue that Smith offers not only “a deeply humane vision” of political economy (p. 22) but a cautionary tale, as well, about the deleterious effects that certain business arrangements can have on workers. Given Smith’s account of how human beings develop their skills, abilities, and even their moral sensibilities and judgment, it turns out that Smith’s concerns are more worrisome than one might suspect. For they can lead to the derangement of human judgment: as Smith puts it, to a “mental mutilation, deformity and wretchedness” that can narrow the horizons of workers’ thought, constrain the preferences they can form, limit the range of options they can consider, and hence endanger their capacity of independent judgment altogether.5

Although Smith’s argument in The Wealth of Nations may indeed reflect “a deeply humane vision,” his own diagnosis of the practical realities for workers should nevertheless lead him to be skeptical about the freedom and independence that commercial society affords. If we take seriously Smith’s prediction of the severe effects of extreme division of labor on workers, we should conclude that businesses can, and often will, inhibit and stifle workers’ capacity for independent judgment. Anderson argues that workers will then be, in a word, unfree.

To be sure, one might resist Anderson’s account for diverse reasons such as our epistemic limits in ascertaining the extent of worker abuse society-wide (Cowen 2017; Robson 2023). We will show, however, that Smith provides key further support for Anderson’s critical central contention that what she calls the “domination” of workers by their bosses in firms can have the practical effect of rendering them unfree. This problem—which we shall call the dominance dynamic—might be so severe that even Anderson’s proposed remedy might fall short in addressing the problem she herself diagnoses. As we will argue, the problem of worker unfreedom, which arises as a result of sentiment malformation under the division of labor, seems to require more aggressive institutional remedy.

In the Theory of Moral Sentiments, Smith observes that “[w]e may often fulfil all the rules of justice by sitting still and doing nothing.”6 According to Smith, there are three “sacred rules of justice,” comprising protections (1) of our “life and person,” (2) of our “property and possessions,” and (3) of our voluntary agreements, contracts, and “promises.”

4 For example, in an important literature review on “Philosophical Approaches to Work and Labor,” Cholbi (2022) mentions Smith (1776) just once and Smith (1759) not at all.
