# CLL treatment in the real world: insights from across the globe

# Second- and later-line therapies in the USA

The analysis reported by Davids et al. at iwCLL 2023 examined the characteristics, treatment patterns and outcomes of a cohort of 1,102 real-world US patients with CLL receiving two or more lines of therapy [1]. Data were obtained from the COTA real-world database. Second-line treatment was initiated between 2014 and 2021. The median patient age at diagnosis was 64 years, 61 % were males, and 88.1 % were treated in the community setting.

Second-line regimens predominantly included ibrutinib, bendamustine plus rituximab (BR), rituximab monotherapy, acalabrutinib, and investigational regimens. In the third line, patients most commonly received ibrutinib, acalabrutinib, and BR. Fourth-line regimens were mainly ibrutinib, rituximab plus venetoclax, and acalabrutinib. In cases, the reasons for discontinuation were classified as “other”. Approximately 18 % of patients died after the initiation of second-line therapies and prior to the start of the third line; 25.5 % of all patients died prior to the initiation of the fourth line. From the start of second-line treatment, median real-world progression-free survival (PFS) was 31.4 months, and median real-world overall survival (OS) was 79.0 months. The authors noted that innovative treatment options and novel mechanisms of action are required to improve outcomes in patients with CLL.

Although targeted agents have improved patient outcomes, the findings suggested that there is still an unmet need. Second-line therapies were discontinued in 77.5 %. Toxicity was the reason for this in 29.0 %, physician preference in 9.4 %, progression in 6.4 % and death in 6.8 %. In almost half of the cases, the reasons for discontinuation were classified as “other”.
