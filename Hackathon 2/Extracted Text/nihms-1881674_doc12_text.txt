# Agenda for Future Research on Workplace Supported Recovery

Although employment may affect SUD treatment and recovery, research on this issue would benefit from assessing the more granular work environment features instead of only broad employment features. A study by Sahker et al., (2019) illustrates why this is important. These researchers analyzed data from 8,925 individuals who participated in various publicly‑funded SUD treatment modalities in Iowa. The researchers explored the associations of several broad employment variables assessed at pretreatment (employment status, employment tenure, and total income) to treatment completion at discharge (i.e., not dropping out of treatment) and alcohol use six months post‑discharge. The authors predicted that these broad employment variables would represent employment‑related recovery supports and, therefore, be related to treatment completion and lower levels of alcohol use. As expected, being employed full‑time (versus being unemployed or out of the labor force), employment tenure, and higher income were associated with higher treatment completion rates. However, contrary to expectation, these same broad employment variables were associated with similar or higher levels of alcohol use at six months post‑discharge rather than lower levels.

Full‑time employment, longer employment tenure, and higher income may represent motivational resources for treatment completion to maintain employment. However, these variables do not tell us if a higher likelihood of treatment completion is an outcome of merely being employed or some more specific work environment features. Likewise, the findings involving post‑discharge alcohol use may not have been unexpected had the researchers examined work environment hazards and (lack of) work‑related support. In other words, the broad employment variables do not provide information on how specific dynamics in the work environment might affect post‑discharge alcohol use. Instead, a more granular assessment of the pretreatment and posttreatment work environment is needed to understand the unexpected finding. This lack of information on the work environment’s granular dimensions also makes it challenging to identify specific recommendations for workplaces and SUD treatment and recovery support providers to leverage the workplace to ameliorate SUDs.

Therefore, we explore work conditions that may influence SUD treatment and recovery. These work conditions, derived from the literature on employee substance use, occupational health, and SUDs, provide an initial agenda for future workplace‑supported recovery research. Before workplace interventions to promote and sustain SUD recovery can be developed and evaluated thoroughly, we need a better understanding of (a) the workplace hazards that need to be eliminated or mitigated and (b) the workplace supports that could be.
