explore how the various work conditions operate together to undermine or support SUD recovery. A lack of research precluded a detailed discussion of two processes central to this issue—moderation and mediation (Frone, 1999, 2019). For example, regarding moderation, high levels of POS may decrease (buffer) the negative impact of workplace SUD stigma on SUD recovery outcomes. Relatedly, research on the processes linking the workplace to SUD recovery can examine heterogeneity across the various special emphasis populations described earlier (see Recovery Theme 3). In terms of mediation, negative work conditions and workplace physical availability of substances may increase workplace norms and rituals supportive of substance use, which reduces the likelihood of recovery among those with a current SUD and increases the likelihood of a SUD recurrence among those in recovery. Finally, future research on workplace supported recovery should endeavor to use longitudinal observational designs and randomized clinical trials to provide more robust causal evidence to motivate employers to consider policies and interventions to address SUD recovery among their employees.

This review demonstrates that little conceptual or empirical work exists on the intersection of work and SUD recovery. In other words, this issue represents an underdeveloped research area where occupational health researchers can have a critical impact on a significant societal and occupational health issue. The proposed research agenda can help occupational health researchers and practitioners develop, refine, and evaluate interventions that leverage the workplace to support and sustain SUD recovery.
