# Clusters and Their Meaning

RESULTS: We recruited 97 stakeholders (individuals with SB 32%, caregivers 21%, healthcare providers 29%, community organizations 18%). Idea generation, followed by editing, revealed 90 unique ideas. After stakeholder sorting, subsequent analysis revealed a seven-cluster concept map (Figure 1) showing how the arrangement (i.e. location and distance between) of the 90 ideas, illustrated by points, have meaning. Each of the seven clusters represents ideas sorted together due to conceptual similarity. Clusters emphasized two key conceptual domains: healthcare access (Clusters 3, 5, 6, and 7) and development of skills that foster empowerment and independence when living with SB (Clusters 1, 2, 4).

CONCLUSIONS: SB community stakeholders identified complex needs relevant to successful transition for individuals with SB from pediatric- to adult-oriented care. Concept map generation allows all SB stakeholders to easily interpret the relationship between ideas, as well as the perspectives of other community members. Both will inform future development of contextually relevant interventions.

(Control ID #3184668)

BACKGROUND: Asthma affects an estimated 39.5 million people in the United States with a total cost of more than $50 billion. Although experts recommend that spirometry is performed for all patients in whom the diagnosis of asthma is being considered and as follow-up at least once every two years after an initial diagnosis is made, the few studies on the subject suggest that spirometry is widely underutilized in the diagnosis of asthma. There have been no studies examining longitudinal use of spirometry in asthma care. We, therefore, examined use of spirometry for both diagnosis and follow up and identified predictors of spirometry in a cohort of primary care patients within one large health system.

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study of adult patients who had a diagnosis of asthma and an appointment in the year of 2014. We used diagnosis codes to randomly identify 200 patients from community health centers and another 200 from private practices. We collected billing records and extracted charts to identify patient characteristics, asthma severity, and the presence or absence of spirometry. We attempted to characterize diagnostic vs follow-up spirometry, but we were unable to do so due to poor documentation in the medical record. We further examined the process of spirometry, including use of the methacholine challenge.

RESULTS: Among our sample of 400 randomly selected subjects, we excluded 6 because they did not have a diagnosis of asthma, resulting in a final analytic dataset of 394 patients. Mean (SD) age was 52 years (13) with a large proportion of the sample being white (61%; n=239) and female (72%; n=284). A total of 75% (n=297) of patients had never had a prior visit with a pulmonologist or allergist. Of the 97 subjects who did see a specialist, 33 (34%) saw a pulmonologist and 74 (76%) saw an allergist. Of the 394 patients, 208 (53%) received spirometry at any time during the follow-up period, and 186 (47%) did not. For patients that received spirometry (n=208), 29.3% (n=61) received a methacholine challenge at any time and of these patients, 83.6% (n=51) showed a positive result, suggesting asthma/airway hyperreactivity. Seeing a specialist was the strongest predictor of whether a patient received spirometry or not: over 90% of those who had a specialist visit received spirometry, compared to 40% of those who did not have a specialist visit.

CONCLUSIONS: Despite the existence of guidelines set forth by experts, we found that spirometry is underused in both the diagnostic evaluation and subsequent monitoring of asthma. Among those who did receive spirometry, diagnostic tools such as the methacholine challenge were rarely used. The chance of receiving spirometry was strongly associated with seeing a specialist, which suggests a need to better incorporate spirometry into routine primary care for patients with asthma.

# Spokesperson-Patient Concordance is Strongly Associated with Patients Choosing to Accept Medical Care Near the End-of-Life

BACKGROUND: A fundamental premise of surrogate decision-making in the context of serious illness is that spokespersons should accurately represent patients' wishes when patients cannot speak for themselves. Prior research using clinical vignettes showed that spokespersons' concordance with patient treatment preferences is imperfect (~50-70%) but factors associated with concordance are not well understood. We assessed whether spokesperson-patient concordance is associated with patient preference to accept vs decline medical interventions.

METHODS: This is a post-hoc analysis of a prospective trial of advance care planning (ACP) among adults with advanced, severe illness (class III/IV heart failure; stage III/IV COPD; stage 4/5 kidney disease; or advanced cancer). The study took place at two tertiary care centers (Hershey, PA and Boston, MA) and the main outcome was spokesperson's concordance with patient preferences. After completing an ACP intervention, participants were asked whether they would ‘accept' or ‘decline' potentially life-saving interventions by responding to 28 questions related to 6 clinical vignettes. Spokespersons were separately asked to indicate which treatments they thought the patient would want. For all questions, patients' responses were classified as choosing to ‘accept' or ‘decline' treatment, and agreement with spokesperson's response was assessed as a dichotomous variable (yes/no). Multivariable logistic regression was performed for each question to assess whether ‘accepting treatment' was associated with agreement after adjusting for study site, diagnosis, and prior advance directive.

RESULTS: 267 spokesperson-patient dyads were included and 7294 paired-responses were analyzed. Patients' mean age was 64 and 46% were female; spokespersons' mean age was 56 and 75% were female. Spokesperson-patient concordance was greater when patients ‘accepted' versus ‘declined' treatment, with significant differences in 24 of 28 questions. The overall median concordance rate was 87% when patients ‘accepted,' and 44% when patients ‘declined' treatment, and the median difference was 46%. On multivariable testing, ‘accepting' treatment was a significant, independent predictor of spokesperson-patient concordance for 24 of 28 questions. The overall median adjusted odds ratio was 10.9 when patients ‘accepted' treatment. By contrast, no correlation was found with patients' or spokespersons' age, sex, race, ethnicity, religion, marital status, education, employment status, study site, prior experience with ACP, or patients' underlying medical condition.

CONCLUSIONS: Spokesperson-patient concordance is strongly associated with patients choosing to accept medical care near the end-of-life.
