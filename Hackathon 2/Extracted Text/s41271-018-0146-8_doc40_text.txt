# Monsanto, PCBs, and the Creation of a World-wide Ecological Concern

In April 1970, the growing body of concern about PCBs reached the top of Monsanto’s leadership group, the Corporate Development Committee. Until this point the Organic Division and the Medical Department were the most actively engaged in developing “facts and knowledge about PCBs through gathering information, visits to universities, and work with industrial test laboratories.” They had kept in contact with “other worldwide producers, and other industrial collaborators” and had followed closely the scientific and other popular literature that addressed the problems of PCBs and environmental pollution. They had also funded “a toxicological and analytical test program in excess of $100 M.” Now the leaders of the Functional Fluids and Plasticizer Business Groups, and the Medical and Law Departments made a presentation to the Corporate Development Committee to discuss their findings, and to provide the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) with the information it would need to develop a long-term and short-term strategy for dealing with the PCB crisis.

The group began with a brief review of PCBs and their relationship to Monsanto’s bottom line. Monsanto’s “worldwide Aroclor business” amounted to over 104 million pounds of which 70 million were functional fluids and 34 million were plasticizers. This resulted in $22 million in sales per year for a gross profit of $10 million per year. They then explained the Aroclor product line ranging from Aroclor 1221 which was a thin liquid to Aroclor 5460 which was a solid. The complete list included:

- Monochlorobiphenyl—Aroclor 1221—Thin Liquid
- Dichlorobiphenyl—Aroclor 1232—Thin Liquid
- Trichlorobiphenyl—Aroclor 1242—Oily Liquid
- Tetrachlorobiphenyl—Aroclor 1248—Oily Liquid
- Pentachlorobiphenyl—Aroclor 1254—Heavy Molasses
- Hexachlorobiphenyl—Aroclor 1260—Thick Tar
- Heptachlorobiphenyl—Aroclor 1262—Thick Tar
- Octachlorobiphenyl—Aroclor 1268—Thick Tar
- Decachlorobiphenyl—Aroclor 1270—Solid
- Terphenyls—Santowax—Solid
- Chlorinated Terphenyl—Aroclor 5460—Solid

They informed the CDC that a significant part of Monsanto’s business was now “being threatened not by competition but by recently found pollution problems,” and that “possible adverse legal and public relations problems [could be] leveled against Monsanto” [125, 126].

The leadership of the Functional Fluids and Plasticizer Business Groups, and the Medical and Law Departments presented four “Alternative Courses of Action” for the company executives to consider. The first alternative was “Do Nothing” but this “was considered unacceptable from a legal, moral, customer & public relations & company policy viewpoint.” It was considered “also the quickest route to being forced out of business.” The second alternative was to “Go out of Total Aroclor business,” and while this was considered unacceptable from a Divisional viewpoint it was presented as a possibility from a corporate viewpoint. Here the committee was asked to consider a partial solution to the company’s problem: “All Aroclor products
