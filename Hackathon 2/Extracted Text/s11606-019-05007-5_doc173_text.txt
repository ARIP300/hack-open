BACKGROUND: Predicting death in noncardiac surgery is important because although death is relatively rare, noncardiac surgeries are very common, with over 25 million procedures per year in the US. In this study, we examined the impact of a comprehensive SMS program on systolic blood pressure (SBP) among individuals with limited (vs. adequate) English proficiency. The 12-month language-concordant, culturally-sensitive SMS program consisted of automated telephone modules, low-literacy written patient-educational materials and telephone health coaching. Impact of the SMS program on change in SBP at 12 months by LEP status was determined using multivariable linear mixed models, controlling for socio-demographic variables and baseline SBP. To explore potential mechanisms underlying differential SMS program impact, engagement with the SMS program (i.e. patient use of educational materials, completion of a health coaching action plan, and duration of automated phone calls), by LEP status was also examined.

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of adult patients who underwent major noncardiac surgeries across four hospitals within an academic medical institution from January 2014 to June 2018. We used four modeling approaches to predict all-cause in-hospital mortality: logistic regression, na√Øve Bayes, random forest, and gradient boosted machine (GBM). Two feature reduction techniques were used to fit the logistic regression models (forward-selection and least absolute shrinkage and selection [LASSO]). 112 clinical variables were extracted and categorized as baseline, preoperative, or intraoperative. Variables were incrementally added to each model and performance was evaluated using AUROC and AUPRC. Though AUROC is an important indicator for model performance, it is not always aligned with how clinicians would use a prediction model. In noncardiac surgery, identifying patients at high risk of death is more critical than identifying patients who do not die. AUROC is immune to changes in class distribution because it is calculated only using sensitivity and specificity and therefore cannot distinguish between models that have equal sensitivity but different precision (positive predictive value). In our context, precision is more clinically meaningful than AUROC, and thus we also examine AUPRC.

RESULTS: Of 137 KARE study participants 53 (38.7%) reported limited English proficiency of which 45 (85%) were Spanish speaking and 8 (15%) Cantonese speaking. While many sociodemographic and clinical variables were similar between groups, individuals with LEP were more likely to be uninsured (39.6% vs. 15.5%, p=0.01) and have less formal education (13.2% vs 47.6% attended some college, p<0.01). Overall, LEP patients randomized to SMS did not have a statistically significant change in SBP compared to English proficient patients randomized to SMS (estimated SBP change: -4.5 (-9.4, 0.3) mmHg for LEP, p=0.07; and -2.1 (-8.6, 4.3) mmHg for English, p=0.51). While LEP and English proficient patients similarly used educational materials provided (82% vs 87%, p= 0.69) and completed a health action plan (81% vs 74%, p=0.49), participants with LEP had significantly longer average automated call duration [3.3 +/-1.4 min vs. 2.2 +/-1.1 min, P<0.01), indicating higher patient engagement.

CONCLUSIONS: Language concordant, culturally appropriate telehealth interventions can be a useful tool in reducing disparities within the LEP population with potential for greater patient engagement and at minimum, similar impact on health outcomes compared to English proficient populations.

# LOCATION MATTERS: THE TYPE OF HOSPITAL UNIT CAN INFLUENCE SATISFACTION WITH PHYSICIAN COMMUNICATION

BACKGROUND: Patient satisfaction has been shown to predict compliance and is an integral part of providing high quality care. Payers such as Medicare now hold hospitals financially accountable for patient experience as measured by the Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS) survey. Predictors of high HCAHPS scores are largely unknown. We sought to determine if the type of hospital unit (general medicine unit or specialty unit) influenced HCAHPS scores for physician communication.

METHODS: We utilized deidentified inpatient care satisfaction data collected from a large academic hospital through the HCAHPS survey from August 2016 through May 2018. Data included demographic information on the patient, discharge provider, length of stay, unit on which patient stayed and their responses to survey topics such as provider communication, overall satisfaction and physician care. Most patients cared for by general internal medicine (GIM) providers at this hospital are admitted to hospital units assigned to the Medicine service, but approximately 30% are admitted to units assigned to other hospital services. Patients of GIM physicians were therefore categorized based on their unit at discharge as medicine or non-medicine. Only hospital stays with a discharging internist/hospitalist provider were included. The overall hospital rating (0-10) was dichotomized to Not Satisfied (0-8) and Satisfied (9-10) categories. Chi square and t-tests were used to compare patients' hospital experience by whether they were located on a medicine or non-medicine unit.
