Another reason for the spike of COVID-19 cases again is the lack of enforcement of the laws. This can be observed through the numbers of people arrested for not following the COVID-19 SOPs. Notably, 4189 people were arrested for defying the MCO as at 1 April 2020, but only 674 people were detained during the RMCO as at 11 October 2020 (Bedi, 2020a, 2020b). Comparing the total population of the two countries, Malaysia has a total 32.69 million population while Singapore only has a 5.69 million population (Department of Statistics Malaysia, 2020a; Department of Statistics Singapore, 2020). Singapore has a smaller population but issued a higher number of fines - 6600 as at 1 July 2020; and 140 working passes of migrant workers were revoked for failing to follow the SOPs. There is also a double standard in meting out punishments - a minister escaped prosecution even though the person breached the quarantines rules (Jaipragas, 2020). Collectively, it can be demonstrated that Malaysia has been lacking in enforcement of laws, and the authorities have not been consistent in executing the laws in the society.

The living conditions of certain groups of people have also contributed to the high number of COVID-19 cases, which can be grouped into three categories. The first is cramped accommodations of rented properties, which have been converted into multiple cubicles or rooms (Bong, 2021). One property might house as many as four or five households, which work out to as many as 20 people in it. Overcrowded living spaces and poor hygiene contributed to the spreading of COVID-19. For example, the people-packed rented properties of Sibu Jaya Flats in Malaysia caused 1079 COVID-19 positive cases on 23 March 2021 (Dayak Daily, 2021b). The second is the longhouses in the states of Sarawak and Sabah, Malaysia; the household units of which are built in close proximity. A longhouse is a stilted timber building with one section divided into a series of individual family rooms, and the other utilized as an open communal area for social gathering. By sharing the common areas with a large number of households, it is difficult to practice social distancing, and hence the chances of infection increase. This space problem led to the occurrence of more than 2000 COVID-19 positive cases as at 9 March 2021 (Dayak Daily, 2021a). The third is foreign employees are housed in overcrowded dorms, which serve as breeding grounds for the coronavirus (Bernama, 2020a). Due to the extreme confined spaces, there was little room for social distancing among the workers. The poor living conditions contributed to the increase in COVID-19 cases in Malaysia. For instance, more than 5000 positive cases occurred in the overcrowded workers’ dorms of Top Glove Corporation in Malaysia as at 30 November 2020 (Hassan, 2020).

To overcome the aforementioned issues, the Malaysian government introduced the enhanced MCO (EMCO) in the infected areas. When an area is declared as EMCO, barbed wire fencing will be installed around the affected area, which is meant to control the movements of the people. Permanent and temporary residents of the infected living places are not permitted to leave their houses, and non-residents are not permitted to enter the area (Hassan et al., 2021). The EMCO is effective in curbing the spread of COVID-19, as it limits people movement in a high-risk area, and reduces the infection rate. It also facilitates early detection of positive cases, screening, and curbing the spread of COVID-19 among the residents. The battle against COVID-19 is still ongoing in Malaysia. For instance, in Sarawak state alone, there were 50 areas under EMCO as at 29 April 2021 (Sarawak Disaster Management Committee, 2021).

In summary, the spike of positive cases in Malaysia from September 2020 to April 2021 was attributed to several factors: failures to follow the SOPs during the Sabah state election; the lack of enforcement of the laws, that is, allowing mass gathering during the MCO for some events; slow in taking actions in handling the outbreak of infection among undocumented immigrants and foreign workers; and poor living conditions of certain groups of people. This raises a question: Can we replicate Singapore’s COVID-19 success model in Malaysia or other Asian countries with high daily new cases? In a longer term, the COVID-19 pandemic is not merely hurting the economy and people’s livelihoods, it will also affect the people’s mental health adversely. The implications of the pandemic to the society will be discussed in the next section.

There is a change in the standard and manner of human interaction due to the pandemic that will affect people’s social wellbeing; for instance, self-quarantine and social distancing. A study conducted by The Centre Malaysia from 5 April to 10 April 2020 among local people residing in Malaysia indicates that 48% of the respondents (Malaysians aged 18 and above) experienced anxiety, and 45% showed signs of depression during the MCO (Azuddin & Zakaria, 2020). The study was conducted during the MCO period with peak daily cases recorded at 235. Using the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS) questionnaires, the online survey was assisted by a consultant psychiatrist. The DASS measures an individual’s emotional well-being in three aspects, namely depression, anxiety and stress (Azuddin & Zakaria, 2020). The survey results indicate that many Malaysians experienced high levels of negative emotions and depression during the first introduced lockdown.

The country’s economic upheaval and uncertain future during the pandemic period fueled worries and chronic anxieties,
