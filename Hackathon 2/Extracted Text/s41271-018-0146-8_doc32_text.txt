# Monsanto, PCBs, and the Recreation of a World-Wide Ecological Concern

Products will be incriminated. The company could be considered derelict, morally if not legally, if it fails to notify all customers of the potential implication” [109].

About 2 weeks later in a document marked “Company Confidential—Attorney-Client Privilege” a second draft of the above report was sent by the committee to Rodney Harris, Jr., Director of Monsanto’s Law Department. This report reviewed the growing knowledge of chlorinated pesticides as well as PCBs over the previous fifteen years. The experience with DDT provided a model for the environmental damage that PCBs were causing:

For the last fifteen years there has been growing world-wide concern regarding the persistence of chlorinated pesticides (particularly DDT) and their universal presence in man, food, animals, fish, birds, air, water, and soil. DDT and its metabolites have been found in virtually every living organism and matter around the globe – including penguins in the Antarctic and the polar ice cap.

Similarly, during just the last few months, PCBs have been reported in:

- a. Milk in Georgia,
- b. Waters of Lake Michigan,
- c. Fish in Connecticut,
- d. Sea food along the Gulf Coast (toxic – fatal to shrimp at Pensacola),
- e. Electric dishwashing compounds,
- f. Milk in Maryland,
- g. Bald Eagles from the mid-west, and
- h. Mother’s milk (rumor – not confirmed) in Denver [110].

The first and a major conclusion of the committee was “That the identification of the PCBs as a contaminant of the environment is certain.” [Emphasis in original] In addition, the committee acknowledged, “There is no question as to the non- or low-biodegradability of the PCBs—particularly the higher chlorinated Aroclors 1254 and 1260 and probably 1248.” It asserted that this was clearly an industry-created problem as “the possibility of [other] origins of the PCBs … is so remote that it is not a satisfactory explanation for their presence.” The report also acknowledged that the highly chlorinated compounds, particularly 1254 and 1260, were widely identified in the literature as contaminants [110].

While the environmental issue was clearly identified in this document, the committee also acknowledged that “possible toxic effects” could result if workers were exposed to this material.

There have been a limited number of cases of occupational disease where workmen have been exposed to excessive vapor inhalation or repeated and prolonged skin contact with subsequent development of skin manifestations (‘chloracne’) or more serious involvement of the liver and kidneys.

In their evaluation, the committee asserted that “PCBs may be ‘moderately toxic’ to man.” They believed that their own toxicological studies on rats and dogs, along with a new study of three generations of rats, to be conducted by their consultant, Industrial BioTest Laboratories, will be made “available to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and other federal and state agencies” and would “confirm that the levels of PCBs being found in nature—and particularly in human.
