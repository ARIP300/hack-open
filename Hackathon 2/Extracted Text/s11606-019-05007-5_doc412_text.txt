# ABSTRACTS

# IMPACT/DISCUSSION:

Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) is an important and rare cause of acute coronary syndrome (ACS). This case demonstrates the importance of thorough workup of chest pain in patients with few to no comorbidities with abnormal ECG, elevated troponin levels, and recent stressor. Literature demonstrates SCAD carries with it significantly increased in-hospital mortality above other non-SCAD acute myocardial infarction causes. Patients with SCAD should at the least have long term medical management including hypertension management and use of a beta blocker, to avoid recurrence of dissection. This case also highlights the range of management depending on severity of dissection.

# CONCLUSION:

SCAD is an important and rare cause of ACS more commonly found in younger women who generally carry fewer comorbidities than other ACS patients. Yet, SCAD is associated with significantly increased mortality above other ACS causes. Depending on findings during angiogram, SCAD management can vary from conservative management (especially hypertension control and beta blocker use) to interventions including coronary stenting.

# CREATIVE SELF-EXPRESSION: ONE PRONG IN A MULTI-MODAL TREATMENT PLAN FOR ADDICTION

# LEARNING OBJECTIVE #1:

Recognize the therapeutic benefit of creative self-expression in the treatment of addiction

# CASE:

Ms. D is a 37-year-old woman with history of opioid use disorder (using intravenous heroin), who presented to our hospital with severe neck pain. She was diagnosed with C-spine osteomyelitis and initiated on IV antibiotic therapy. Her course was complicated by cardiac arrest from heroin overdose (provided by a personal visitor). During her hospitalization, she was initiated on buprenorphine and met regularly with an art therapist. She created drawings and small sculptures that depicted her years-long struggle with heroin use, as well as emotional traumas that contributed to her use. Prior to discharge, she shared her artwork with her medical team, eloquently articulating how creating art helped her process her trauma and make a commitment to recovery.

# IMPACT/DISCUSSION:

Addictions are an increasingly pressing national health concern. Many elements of Ms. D's case—her early childhood trauma, her life-threatening medical complications—will likely be familiar to internists who care for patients with substance use disorders. This presentation will focus on a promising and understudied aspect of addiction treatment: creative self-expression. Creative self-expression can be joyful, relaxing, and distracting from other difficulties. It also empowers patients to create their own narratives of self, recognizes patients' subjective experiences, and provides means of communicating difficult experiences with the clinical team and others. There is a strong theoretical foundation for the use of self-expression as a means for improved wellbeing in the medical setting and in trauma recovery (1,2). Current empirical data are encouraging but limited by small sample size, lack of objective metrics, and heterogeneity of art therapy modalities (3,4). This presentation will introduce conference participants to the robust theoretical basis of creative self-expression in healing and recovery. This theoretical basis will then be applied to a discussion of Ms. D's case. The presentation will include photographs of Ms. D's artwork, for which she has provided her consent.

# CONCLUSION:

This case demonstrates the therapeutic potential of creative self-expression as part of a multi-modal treatment strategy for addiction.

# CUTANEOUS CRYPTOCOCCUS NEOFORMANS: A FATAL WARNING SIGN.

Tania M. Kohal; Ahmad D. Dudar; Gillian Grafton. Henry Ford Hospital, Detroit, MI. (Control ID #3162884)

# LEARNING OBJECTIVE #1:

Understand the incidence of cutaneous manifestations of cryptococcal infections and its relation to systemic cryptococcal infection.

# LEARNING OBJECTIVE #2:

Identify cryptococcal skin lesions.

# CASE:

An 81 year old woman presented to the medical intensive care unit as an outside transfer for escalation of care. Two months prior to this hospitalization the patient was fully independent and lived alone; however, she had a recent admission for renal failure which revealed an ANCA-positive vasculitis with myeloperoxidase antibody elevation and crescentic pauci-immune glomerulonephritis on renal biopsy. She was discharged on a maintenance dose of prednisone, but began to clinically deteriorate shortly thereafter at home with decline in mental status and renal function. The patient was transferred from an outside hospital to our facility with acute encephalopathy and cellulitis. On arrival, physical exam revealed skin lesions on the bilateral upper extremities and right lower extremity that were violaceous and purpuritic as well as areas of induration and necrosis. Blood cultures revealed a gram positive bacteremia. Dermatology was consulted with the request of a skin biopsy given the patient's prior history. On the day of the skin biopsy the patient had further clinical deterioration with progressive hypoxia requiring intubation as well as renal failure and severe lactic acidosis. She was treated with broad spectrum antibiotics as well as anti-fungals; however her clinical status continued to deteriorate and eventually she expired within 48 hours of admission. Her skin biopsy revealed disseminated encapsulated yeast consistent with Cryptococcus neoformans.

# IMPACT/DISCUSSION:

Cryptococcus neoformans is a dimorphic fungus that is ubiquitous in the environment, found in soil, dust, wild and domesticated birds as well as a skin contaminant. Clinically, its primary manifestation is pulmonary infection; however, 10-15% of clinical manifestations are cutaneous. Cutaneous manifestations can be diverse including plaques, crusts, nodules, or microhemorrhages. When presented with an individual with cutaneous manifestations, the patient should be assumed to have systemic infection unless proven otherwise, and this case demonstrates that delay in treatment can become fatal. The diagnostic challenge in this case was identifying a patient with known immunocompromised status presenting with no other objective data of cryptococcal meningitis or pulmonary infection. The patient was started on antifungals; however, not with enough alacrity to become effective.

# CONCLUSION:

Cryptococcosis can be encountered around the world and the majority of its clinical manifestations will be elucidated via the common infectious routes; however, there are opportunities to diagnose cryptococcosis and treat patient faster in an attempt to reduce morbidity and mortality from this infection. One of these opportunities is assessment of new dermatological manifestations of unknown origin in at risk patients.
