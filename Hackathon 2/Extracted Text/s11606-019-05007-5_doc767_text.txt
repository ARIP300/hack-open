There residents were also the participants in our focus group and ongoing training program.

# DESCRIPTION:

A targeted needs assessment, a combination of 3 validated surveys on workplace/gender culture, burnout and empowerment was sent to female residents. Surveys were sent to 60 female residents, and to date we have a 30% response rate. Preliminary results show that 69% of respondents felt that women had fewer opportunities for professional development at work than men, 69% felt that men receive more organizational support than women, and 87% stated they would like to receive more support in the workplace. Data collection still is ongoing. These early results reveal an opportunity to provide support and professional development to our female trainees. A focus group of five female trainees identified a need for a "safe-space" to discuss issues specific to being female residents. Participants identified desired topics, including negotiation, leading an effective team, work-life integration, public speaking, self-advocacy and addressing microaggressions and gender bias in the workplace. Based on this preliminary data, we developed a 6-session mentoring and empowerment training program for female internal medicine residents. Each session includes a learner-centered workshop on a topic from the focus group, and time for mentoring. Sessions are held at the hospital after working hours for ease of attendance.

# EVALUATION:

Three workshops have been held, with attendance ranging from 5-15 participants. Pre- and post-workshop surveys focused on perceived knowledge and comfort with topics covered will be given at each session, the results of which are forthcoming. The needs assessment survey will be repeated at the end of the year to reassess participant's sense of support and opportunity for career advancement.

# DISCUSSION / REFLECTION / LESSONS LEARNED:

Our needs assessment shows a need amongst female residents for a place to receive support and career training. Our program provides a learner-centered, innovative way to provide this. Variability in attendance is attributed to variable resident schedules, and we plan to optimize schedules to enhance attendance going forward.

# YES WE CAN! A SELF-MANAGEMENT CURRICULUM TEACHING PATIENT SELF-EFFICACY CAN IMPACT PATIENT OUTCOMES IN A RESOURCE POOR, UNDERSERVED ACADEMIC PRIMARY CARE SETTING.

# NEEDS AND OBJECTIVES:

1. Outline an experiential curriculum for medical students to teach patient self-management skills
2. Enhance learner confidence and satisfaction in helping patients set behavioral health goals.
3. Demonstrate that student-administered health coaching can improve patient clinical and behavioral health outcomes.

# SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS:

Our academic, safety net, hospital-based clinic provides care to uninsured patients with multiple chronic illnesses. To address barriers that underserved patients face towards adopting healthier nutrition habits, our clinic provides weekly Healthy Living Group Classes. These interactive nutrition and behavior based classes are taught by medical student volunteers who also spend class time facilitating patient goal setting.

# DESCRIPTION:

The Healthy Living class curriculum is continually modified by patient feedback and has been reviewed by nutritionists. Students review the class syllabus outlining topics and educational discussion points for each session. Volunteer students also work with patients via telephone to set, assess, and reframe (if necessary) self-management goals every 1-2 weeks.

# EVALUATION:

In 2017-2018, more than thirty medical students voluntarily delivered health coaching to patients via weekly group classes or individualized telephone health coaching. Likert-scale survey results show high learner satisfaction; reflections submitted by student volunteers disclose impactful experiences and a deep understanding of barriers patients face in accessing health care. The tele-health coaching pilot (mean duration 4.6 months) conducted by phone involved 27 patients, with 4 patients dropping out. Changes in patient behaviors (goal attainment, medication adherence, and show rates to appointments) as well as patient systolic blood pressures improved during that time period. Preliminary data from 26 patients who attended more than one Healthy Living class between October 2017-September 2018 showed that 73% of patients lost weight. Of those who lost weight, 10 patients (52%) lost over 5 lbs each.

# DISCUSSION / REFLECTION / LESSONS LEARNED:

Experience-based models may improve medical student confidence in teaching patient self-management skills. Such interventions demonstrate positive clinical outcomes and improved health behaviors for small samples of patients. Our intervention has several limitations including small sample size, no control group, and selection bias as students participate voluntarily.

# YOU CAN DO IT: USING A MI CURRICULUM TO ENHANCE STUDENT LEARNING, ENGAGE PATIENTS, AND PROMOTE HEALTHY BEHAVIORS

# NEEDS AND OBJECTIVES:

1. Describe the fundamental principles, steps, and techniques of Motivational Interviewing.
2. Demonstrate core skills of Motivational Interviewing.
3. Apply Motivational Interviewing skills for health promotion in the clinical setting.

# SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS:

The curricular initiative was implemented as a core requirement for all clinical clerkship students at a single medical school (N=155).

# DESCRIPTION:

Using Kolb's Experiential Learning Cycle as a Model, a 4-part MI curriculum, "Promoting Healthy Behaviors," was implemented in our longitudinal primary care clerkship to enhance learning in motivational interviewing. The curriculum includes self-directed learning, small-group exercises, standardized patient practice, AND a real-life clinical intervention (medication adherence, lifestyle modification, or substance cessation) with patient follow-up and reflection.

# EVALUATION:

Students completed anonymous surveys regarding their learning experience with the project, their respective patient's goal progress at the time of follow-up, and feedback on the project. Data was analyzed via quantitative and qualitative methods. Three faculty members coded qualitative responses independently through open coding. Disagreement was resolved by discussion and data recoded by a final coding scheme. The authors discussed the coded data to arrive at a final set of themes.

# DISCUSSION / REFLECTION / LESSONS LEARNED:

Rich reflections were collected through the student evaluations and the following themes across the knowledge, skills, and attitude learning domains emerged: Meeting patients "where they are at" on the Stages of Change scale is key in promoting change. Behavioral change is difficult and takes considerable support and follow-up. Incremental changes, tapping into internal motivation, and addressing barriers aid in success. Motivational interviewing is an impactful way to promote healthy behaviors and important skill to learn. 78% of patients reported progress towards their self-directed health behavioral change goal established in the student-led MI encounter at 4 to 6 weeks post-encounter. Over half of students agreed that
