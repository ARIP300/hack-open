the project helped them learn to effectively counsel patients using a patient-centered approach. Lessons learned: Patient follow-up after the initial MI encounter enhanced learning and contributed greatly to the transformative process but was also a barrier for some students. Students appreciate earlier exposure and expanded opportunities to utilize and receive feedback on MI skills. Conclusion: The Promoting Healthy Behaviors project is an effective method of enhancing multi-dimensional medical student learning in motivational interviewing and engaging patients in behavior change and health promotion. A clinical intervention with follow-up helped students appreciate their potential impact, recognize the difficulties patients experience in moving towards behavioral change, and provided "immediate applicability" for skills learned through the in-class and standardized patient exercises.
