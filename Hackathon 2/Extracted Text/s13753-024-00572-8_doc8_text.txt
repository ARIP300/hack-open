# Adekola and Chia. Stakeholder Theory, Public Engagement, and Epistemic Injustice

A challenge in accurately capturing the nuances of diverse perspectives and experiences, potentially leading to a dilution of concerns during decision making, and the unintentional marginalization or misinterpretation of specific communities’ experiences.

# 5.5 Unfair Existing Vulnerability

The fifth condition of epistemic injustice is that to be unfairly discriminated against as a knower, one must undergo concurrent experiences of other social injustices thereby implying an already existing unjustifiable vulnerability. In the context of Scotland, the ACB communities comprise mostly first-generation migrants, many are still on visas (for example, student and work visas) or are asylum seekers or refugees with several restrictions on where and how much they can work, exposing them to several vulnerabilities related to visa restrictions, unemployment/underemployment, lack of opportunities, and a general lack of trust in systems including the healthcare system. Participants also expressed deep-seated distrust stemming from historical injustices and systemic racism. Specifically, they pointed to a lack of opportunities for Black people with one participant (Glasgow community leader 3) at the Glasgow community event explaining that:

“It is time for us to look at what Covid has exposed to us ... You know, we have people who are qualified for positions, they are not getting it, we can’t even get the reasons why they are not getting it.”

Similarly, in the Edinburgh community discussion, another participant highlighted the income and work challenges experienced by the Black and other ethnic minority communities in Scotland:

“People went into care and cleaning because the jobs were there during Covid, people had been pushed to go to these jobs ... You go to any organizations that help ethnic minority groups and the first thing they tell you about is a nursing home. And at the beginning, I did it, I did my fair share of care because that was the only way in Ireland, Dublin that I could get a visa, and that was because I didn’t want to be illegal. So the only way I could get anything, a working document … work permits were coming only through that and cleaning.”

This vulnerable position is exacerbated by a perceived connection between public health services and immigration status, causing apprehension within migrant communities. Furthermore, refugee policies like the Rwanda policy add a layer of complexity to the experiences of undocumented migrants, compounding their challenges in accessing essential services and support. This underscores the multifaceted challenges related to the experience of the ACB communities in Scotland that make them socially vulnerable to epistemic injustice.
