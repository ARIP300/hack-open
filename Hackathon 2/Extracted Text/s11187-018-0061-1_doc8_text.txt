# 5 Discussion

The present paper extends recent entrepreneurship research, using a strict conceptualization and measurement of ADHD, that is, ADHD as a clinically diagnosed condition. We find that, in spite of ADHD’s downsides and individuals having sufficient disorder as to be clinically diagnosed, ADHD positively rather than negatively affects the likelihood of venturing. Building on prior research, this elucidates that a dark and pathologized condition can serve as a wellspring for entrepreneurial action. Certainly, future research is needed, examining entrepreneurial action at a much more granular level, and the eventual outcomes of such action beyond the nascent stage (Lerner et al. 2018b). Nonetheless, without entrepreneurial action there would simply be no entrepreneurship and no new ventures (Baron 2007, p. 167). Furthermore, given the myriad unproductive and destructive behaviors also linked to ADHD, entrepreneurial action may be a constructive outlet regardless of whether a venture is ultimately founded and successful. Finally, understanding whether there is scientific evidence of a positive link between the clinical condition of ADHD and initiating entrepreneurship provides a basis for embarking on research attempting to capture more complex dynamics and outcomes.

This complements the qualitative findings of Wiklund et al. (2016), as well as Verheul et al.’s (2016) quantitative findings based on dichotomized ASRS v1.1 scoring. Based on our large-scale quantitative testing that did not preselect on either ADHD status or observable entrepreneurs, and prior to the possibility of entrepreneurship as last resort, we find evidence that individuals diagnosed with ADHD are more likely to take entrepreneurial action than individuals without such a diagnosis. It suggests the potential adaptiveness of the unequivocally pathological—going beyond behavioral traits such as impulsivity to a full-blown clinical disorder/diagnosis. Our findings empirically advance emergent theory involving ADHD and clinical conditions in general, and are in line with recent.

# 5.1 Cautions and limitations

It is important to underscore that entrepreneurial action and performance are not synonymous. The linkage found between ADHD and venturing/entrepreneurial action should not be conflated, nor interpreted as a positive link with venture performance. The present study cannot speak to the effect of ADHD on venture performance or other entrepreneurial outcomes. Rather, it suggests the need and opportunity for future research in this direction. Since potential venturing outcomes include everything from success to catastrophic loss (with negative outcomes more likely if inattentive to foreseeable pitfalls or if impulsively spending through savings, high-interest debt, or home equity), future research is needed to more fully understand the connection between ADHD and venturing, including if entrepreneurship is on average a good fit for individuals with ADHD. Suffice to say, the connection between ADHD and later stages of organizing, profitability, and growth are yet unknown—and it is unlikely to be entirely rosy or dark (Lerner et al. 2018b).

Our study has several limitations. The simple, straightforward design and sample used were appropriate for the critical research question of whether actual ADHD and the likelihood of entrepreneurial action are positively connected. The resultant coefficient estimates, while likely conservative in nature for aforementioned reasons, should however not be presumed to be broadly generalizable to other populations (Antshel 2017; Canits et al. 2018). At an even deeper level, it is important to recall that generalizability is not per se a property of any empirical study, but rather is a question of whether a theoretical relationship generalizes across empirical contexts (Zelditch 1969). As our findings quite strongly ground prior research and establish the central theorized relationship, they indicate the fruitfulness of future research involving other populations, other designs, and more complex theory.
