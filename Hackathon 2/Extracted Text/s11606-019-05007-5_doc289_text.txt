# Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) Management in Primary Care

BACKGROUND: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is common in the primary care setting. Early interventions may prevent progression of renal disease and reduce risk for cardiovascular disease. The purpose of this study was to assess whether implementation of a primary care improvement model results in improved identification and management of CKD compared to usual care.

METHODS: This 18-month group randomized trial was conducted from November 1, 2016 to April 30, 2018 in 21 practices in 13 U.S. states. Seventy-one physicians and 41 midlevel providers participated. All practices received performance reports as frequently as monthly on a set of 11 CKD clinical quality measures (CQMs) reflecting clinical practice guidelines related to screening for albuminuria in at-risk patients, monitoring (eGFR, albuminuria and hemoglobin), use of ACE-inhibitors or ARBs, blood pressure and glycemic control, statin therapy, and avoidance of NSAIDs. To promote implementation of practice improvement strategies derived from prior research and adapted to overcome known barriers to CKD care, 11 practices randomized to the intervention group hosted an on-site visit and 2 follow up webinars, and sent 2 representatives to a "best practice" meeting. The primary outcomes were changes in practice adherence to CKD CQMs over the 18-month trial. Linear mixed-effects regression models were used to compare changes over time for each CQM between intervention and control practices. Qualitative analyses of data obtained from site visits, webinars and the meeting were used to assess each practice's fidelity to implementation of the improvement strategies.

RESULTS: There were statistically significant greater improvements in intervention practices for annual screening for albuminuria in patients with diabetes or hypertension (absolute change 22% in intervention group vs. -2.6% in control group, p<0.0001) and annual monitoring for albuminuria in patients with CKD (absolute change 21% in intervention group vs. -2.0% in control group, p<0.0001). Avoidance of NSAIDs in patients with CKD declined in both intervention and control groups, with a significantly greater decline in the control practices (absolute change -5.0% in intervention group vs. -10% in control group, p<0.0001). There were no other significant changes found for the other CQMs. There was variable implementation of CKD-specific improvement strategies across the intervention practices.

CONCLUSIONS: Implementation of a primary care improvement model designed to improve CKD identification and management resulted in significantly improved care on 3 out of 11 CKD CQMs compared to usual care over 18 months. Incomplete adoption of improvement strategies may have limited further improvement. Achieving improved adherence to other CKD guidelines likely requires a longer and more intensive intervention.

# TRAUMA EXPOSURE, HEALTH STATUS, AND DISEASE BURDEN AMONG MINORS SEEKING ASYLUM IN THE US

BACKGROUND: Over the past decade, there has been an unprecedented influx of immigrant children seeking asylum or other forms of humanitarian relief into the US. For example, between 2009 and 2014, there was a 1,437% increase in unaccompanied alien children apprehended at the Southwest Border from El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras. Driven primarily by epidemic levels of domestic, gang, and gender-based violence, many of these children have experienced multiple types of trauma in their country of origin, as well as additional trauma during migration and post-migration. Previous studies of immigrant, asylee, and refugee children identify a relationship between trauma exposure and poor mental health outcomes. Comparatively little is known about the trauma exposure and health status of this current wave of immigrant children, or the impact of more recent changes and conditions in their countries of origin, during migration, or related to US immigration policies and practices.

METHODS: This study is a retrospective analysis of completed forensic health evaluations for child and adolescent immigrants evaluated as part of Physicians for Human Rights' Asylum Program between January 2014 and April 2018.

RESULTS: Evaluations for 183 individuals were included in this analysis (114 male and 69 female), with an average age of 15 years at the time of evaluation. Most were from the "Northern Triangle" countries (89%) comprised of El Salvador (36%), Guatemala (19%), and Honduras (34%). They experienced multiple forms of trauma including direct physical (78%) and sexual violence (18%), threats of violence/death (71%) and forced gang conscription (24%), and witnessed acts of violence (59%). The perpetrators were most often family (47%) and gang members (60%). Major vulnerability factors present in this group included parental separation (66%) or parent death (11%). Health evaluations revealed that 76% had at least one major mental health diagnosis, most commonly post-traumatic stress disorder (64%), major depressive disorder (40%), and anxiety disorder (19%).

CONCLUSIONS: Child and adolescent asylum seekers often have multiple types of repeated trauma exposures resulting in significant medical and mental health consequences. It is essential to enhance culturally sensitive, trauma-informed care for these vulnerable populations, while limiting practices and policies that could contribute to further trauma exposure and negative health outcomes during all phases of migration.

# TRAUMA INFORMED CARE NEEDS ASSESSMENT OF INTERNAL MEDICINE RESIDENTS

BACKGROUND: In the US, 60-90% of adults have experienced emotional traumaâ€“ defined as an event or series of events (such as abuse, loss, or chronic stressors) that negatively affect health. Trauma exposure is strongly associated with proportional increases in chronic diseases, behavioral health disorders, and risky behaviors. These negative sequelae disproportionately affect ethnic minorities and urban, underserved populations. Physicians and healthcare providers can play important roles in intervention or re-traumatization of victims. However, current standard medical training does not include trauma or Trauma Informed Care (TIC). We aimed to examine the knowledge, attitudes, perceived skills, and behaviors of Internal Medicine residents regarding managing patients with histories of trauma, as well as residents' desires for additional training in trauma informed care.

METHODS: We conducted an online survey of residents enrolled in 4 Internal Medicine programs in Baltimore, Maryland to assess the following behaviors: recognizing, screening, managing, and referring patients with trauma histories. The questionnaire was based on PREMIS (Physician Readiness to Manage Intimate Partner Violence Survey) and addressed residents' knowledge, attitudes, self-assessed preparedness, and close personal experiences with trauma. Nonparametric tests (Kruskal-Wallis, Fisher's exact, and Wilcoxon rank sum) were used for analysis.

RESULTS: Of the 168 residents who responded to the survey (54% response rate), 44% were female, 55% White, 28% Asian, 4% Black and 13.2% unknown/other. Knowledge and preparedness were very limited. 83% percent of respondents underestimated trauma prevalence; 31.7% felt inadequately prepared to appropriately respond to positive disclosures. 59.5% reported they seldom asked about trauma in the past 6 months, and 8.8% never asked. Factors significantly associated with higher frequency of screening patients include greater perceived preparedness to identify, respond to, and refer patients (p =.0001 .012); familiarity with referral resources (p=.005); comfort in discussing trauma with patients (p =.003); and perceived faculty (p =.001) and workplace support (p =.038). 68.7% had previous training on some trauma-related topics in medical school, and 42.2% did in residency; 91.8% wished for additional training on trauma and trauma informed care. Differences among genders, races, years in training, and program sites were minimal.
