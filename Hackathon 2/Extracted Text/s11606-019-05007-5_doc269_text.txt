# Lower Sleep Opportunity and Incident Delirium

10.39% (SD = 0.32) of admissions. Compared to the highest quartile of sleep opportunity (6.57-8.00 hours), the lowest quartile of sleep opportunity (0.93-3.62 hours) was associated with a significantly increased odds of incident delirium (adjusted odds ratio 1.80 [95% CI: 1.11-2.93]). The middle quartiles (3.62-4.67 hours and 4.67-6.57 hours) were not significantly different from the highest quartile (adjusted odds ratios 1.36 [0.84-2.22] and 1.56 [0.98-2.46], respectively).

CONCLUSIONS: Lower sleep opportunity overnight in the hospital was associated with an increased risk for incident delirium, highlighting the clinical importance of minimizing unnecessary interruptions. These results also show that our sleep opportunity metric has clinically meaningful correlates.

BACKGROUND: Subclinical hypothyroidism (SHypo) has been linked to an increased risk for coronary heart disease (CHD). Moreover, SHypo has been associated with several modifiable cardiovascular risk factors, but population-based data on these associations are inconsistent. Also, the impact of hormonal substitution in SHypo on CHD remains unclear with the lack of adequately powered trials. By pooling individual participant data from large prospective cohort studies, this international cross-sectional study assessed the association between SHypo and cardiovascular risk factors across wide age ranges to help clarify the possibly increased risk for cardiovascular events in patients with SHypo.

METHODS: Cardiovascular risk factors (arterial hypertension, dyslipidemia, inflammatory status as determined by hs-CRP) as primary outcomes were assessed in euthyroid (TSH 0.45-4.5 mU/l) and participants with SHypo (TSH >4.5 mU/l, normal free thyroxine) from large cohorts within the Thyroid Studies Collaboration (www.thyroid-studies.org). Participants on exposure-/outcome-modifying medications [antihypertensives, lipid-lowering drugs, antidiabetics, and (anti-)thyroid medication] were excluded and analyses stratified by gender due to significant interactions. Multilevel mixed-effects linear regression models adjusted for age and smoking status were used.

RESULTS: Among 50,045 participants (mean age 58, range 18-100 years, 59% women, 27% current smokers) from 13 international cohorts, 2,832 (6%) individuals had SHypo. All associations significantly differed by gender (p for interaction<0.001; HDL-cholesterol p for interaction=0.03), except for hs-CRP (p for interaction=0.60). Systolic blood pressure was higher with SHypo vs euthyroidism in women (138±10 vs 135±11 mmHg, p<0.01), but not in men (138±7 vs 138±7 mmHg, p=0.70) as was total cholesterol (women 6.10±0.56 vs 6.03±0.52 mmol/l, p<0.001; men 5.41±0.53 vs 5.74±0.41 mmol/l, p=0.39). With SHypo HDL-cholesterol levels were lower (women 1.48±0.06 vs 1.51±0.05 mmol/l, p<0.001; men 1.16±0.04 vs 1.23±0.04 mmol/l, p<0.001) and triglyceride levels higher (women 1.50±0.24 vs 1.38±0.22 mmol/l, p<0.001; men 1.68±0.31 vs 1.67±0.24 mmol/l, p<0.05) in both women and men, while LDL-cholesterol levels were slightly higher only in women (4.16±0.56 vs 4.12±0.55 mmol/l, p<0.001; men 3.68±0.51 vs 3.96±0.44 mmol/l, p=0.83). hs-CRP levels were similar in SHypo vs euthyroidism for both genders (women 2.01±0.70 vs 1.91±0.67 mg/l, p=0.24; men 1.81±0.67 vs 1.64±0.68 mg/l, p=0.39). Cardiovascular risk factors did not significantly differ across age groups.

CONCLUSIONS: SHypo is associated with elevations of traditional cardiovascular risk factors (but not hs-CRP levels) that differ according to gender, but not age. However, the differences may not be of clinical relevance as they are small. Therefore, cardiovascular risk factors do not appear to be a strong argument to substitute SHypo.

# THE ASSOCIATION OF LANGUAGE PREFERENCE AND OUTCOMES IN HISPANICS WITH ATRIAL FIBRILLATION

BACKGROUND: According to the U.S. Census Bureau in 2011, 21% of Americans speak a language other than English at home. Of non-English speakers, 13% identify as Spanish-speaking primarily. This likely results in many Spanish-speaking individuals visiting physicians who cannot communicate with them in their primary language. The association between language preference and outcomes in atrial fibrillation is unknown.

METHODS: This study analyzed the association of language preference with length of hospital stay and all-cause mortality in Hispanics admitted with atrial fibrillation. This is a retrospective study of Hispanic patients aged 18 years or older admitted with a primary diagnosis of atrial fibrillation between the years 2000 and 2010. Deaths were ascertained from the social security index as well as records from the New York Department of Health. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to determine predictors of survival adjusted for age and comorbidities.

RESULTS: A total of 957 patients were identified with a mean follow up of 3.7 years. 476 (50%) patients reported Spanish as their primary language. Overall mortality was higher in the Spanish-speakers relative to English-speakers. (34% vs 26%, p < 0.001). After adjusting for age and co-morbidities, Hispanic Spanish-speakers did not have increased mortality when compared to Hispanic English-speakers (OR: 1.063, CI: 0.777-1.454). However, Spanish language preference was associated with a significantly increased length of hospital stay (4.50 days (95% CI 4.20-4.80) vs 5.45 days (95% CI 5.01-5.89)).

CONCLUSIONS: This study illustrates the importance of recognizing the association of an increased length of hospital stay and Spanish language preference in hopes of improving the efficiency.
