# LEARNING OBJECTIVE #1:

Recognize giant cell arteritis (GCA) in patients with aortic aneurysms despite the absence of typical GCA symptoms.

# LEARNING OBJECTIVE #2:

Conduct more studies to assess the efficacy of screening for aortic involvement in patients with giant cell arteritis.

# CASE:

A 74-year-old male patient with a known history of hypertension and hypothyroidism presented with atypical chest pain for three days. The patient was a nonsmoker and family history was significant for hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus. On physical examination, vitals were significant for mild tachycardia, blood pressure 138/75, oxygen saturation 98% on ambient air and afebrile. Physical examination was normal. Serial troponins were negative and electrocardiogram showed no ischemic changes. Further evaluation with chest computed tomography (CT) showed large ascending aortic aneurysm measuring 5.7 cm. After medical optimization, the patient underwent surgical repair of the ascending aortic aneurysm. A specimen of the dilated aorta was sent to pathology which showed multinucleated giant cells and associated positive elastin break in the lamina which was consistent with giant cell arteritis. Oral glucocorticoids therapy was recommended. However, the patient declined medical treatment after understanding risks and benefits. During a two year follow up the patient did not have any indication of disease relapse.

# IMPACT/DISCUSSION:

Giant cell arteritis (GCA) is a granulomatous inflammatory disease affecting individuals older than 50 years. Clinically, it comprises overlapping presentations including cranial arteritis and extracranial GCA (large-vessel GCA). The presentation of GCA in large-vessel is seen in limb claudication, aortic aneurysm, and aortic dissection. Our patient presented with chest pain and did not present with the typical symptoms of GCA; temporal headache, jaw claudication or ophthalmic symptoms. The aorta may be affected in about a third of patients according to one prospective study assessing large vessel involvement. However, aortic aneurysms are very uncommon and appear in only 6% of patients with large vessel involvement. Retrospective studies have demonstrated a higher prevalence of aortic aneurysm among patients with GCA compared with the general population. Most clinicians recommend steroid treatment as long as the patient is showing disease activity or elevated inflammatory markers. In reviewing the literature, there were no clear guidelines to screen for aortic aneurysms in GCA patients, although studies have shown that aortic aneurysm those patients have increased risk of dissection.

# CONCLUSION:

Giant cell arteritis is a common cause of vasculitis, however, a rare cause of ascending aortic aneurysm. Giant cell arteritis should be in the differential diagnosis of patients presenting with aortic aneurysms even in the absence of typical GCA symptoms. The need for screening guidelines to look for aortic aneurysms and close follow up should be considered in patients with Giant Cell arteritis.

# NOT YOUR TYPICAL HEART ATTACK

# LEARNING OBJECTIVE #1:

Recognize the clinical features of postpartum spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD)

# LEARNING OBJECTIVE #2:

Understand the importance of early recognition of SCAD to reduce mortality

# CASE:

A 39-year-old woman presented with 1 hour of sudden onset chest pain. She had no cardiovascular (CV) risk factors, no family history of cardiac disease, and denied any drug use. Further history revealed that she had an uncomplicated vaginal delivery 1 month ago. On presentation, she was hemodynamically stable, but troponin T was elevated to 2.39 ng/mL and ECG revealed ST elevations in the inferior leads. She was taken for urgent coronary catheterization, which showed only mild luminal narrowing of the mid first obtuse marginal. However, given a high clinical suspicion for coronary artery dissection, further intracoronary imaging with optical coherence tomography (OCT) was done, revealing a large intramural hematoma with focal intimal disruption and significant obstruction of the true lumen. This confirmed the diagnosis of spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD), leading to an inferior wall myocardial infarction (MI). She was managed medically with aspirin and metoprolol. Her chest pain soon resolved, troponins trended down, and ST segments normalized. She was discharged on medical therapy and remains stable with preserved cardiac function.

# IMPACT/DISCUSSION:

SCAD is a rare yet potentially fatal cause of chest pain that accounts for 0.2% of cases of acute coronary syndrome. In SCAD, an intimal tear creates an intramural hematoma, leading to compression of the true lumen and resultant MI. SCAD mainly occurs in young women with few, if any, of the traditional CV risk factors, and is associated with the postpartum period. The pathogenesis is not fully understood, but may be related to the progesterone-induced alterations in elastic fiber content that weaken the arterial walls, and the increased cardiac demand of pregnancy and stress of labor that further predispose to dissection. Recent studies have also identified specific genetic loci that may be associated with SCAD. In our case, lack of risk factors in this otherwise healthy woman strongly implicated her recent pregnancy as the main precipitating cause of SCAD. Given this clinical suspicion, OCT, with its high resolution and superior ability to visualize intracoronary pathology, was used to confirm the diagnosis. Failure to recognize and diagnose SCAD can lead to an MI, acute heart failure, cardiogenic shock, and death. In fact, the short-term mortality associated with SCAD is about 50%, and reaches 70% in patients who present with MI. Thus, SCAD presents a unique diagnostic challenge because although uncommon, it can be fatal if missed, and requires accurate history taking and clinical acumen to promptly diagnose and manage these high-risk patients.

# CONCLUSION:

Acute MIs rarely occur in young patients with no CV risk factors. This case illustrates the need to maintain a high index of suspicion for SCAD in postpartum women presenting with chest pain.

# LEARNING OBJECTIVE #1:

To consider disseminated cutaneous varicella zoster virus in an HIV patient with a rash on his palms and soles.

# CASE:

A 46 year-old male with a history of HIV presented with lower back/flank pain and rash. Three days before admission, the patient experienced 8/10 sharp pain in right lower back/flank; the pain was also associated with shooting pain to palpation, with subsequent numbness two days later. At this time, the patient also developed a non-pruritic, non-painful, diffuse maculopapular rash over his whole body and bruising over his arms. The patient had not been on HAART for over five months due to insurance issues, and had no known history of chickenpox or varicella zoster virus (VZV) vaccinations. On exam, the patient was afebrile. Other vital signs were as follows: BP 114/72 mmHg, HR 109 bpm, RR 20 bpm and SpO2 97% on room air. Physical exam was significant for a warm, edematous confluent rash with overlying pustules on his right back/flank following dermatomes T9 through T11 to mid-back; the area had decreased sensation. Additionally, the patient had a diffuse red maculopapular rash (lesions 1-4mm) over his entire body, including his palms, soles, head and scrotum, with crusting in different stages. Initial labs showed CD4 count 250 with viral load 60,100; CBC
