Individuals in recovery acknowledge the importance of recognizing the need for change and being personally involved in and responsible for their recovery (Sheedy & Whitter, 2009).

# Recovery Theme 3: Recovery Represents an Individualized Growth Process

Recovery represents an individualized growth process because individual differences exist in the causes, severity, and outcomes of a SUD, internal and external resources available to address the disorder, and personal priorities (Ashford et al., 2019). Therefore, multiple pathways to recovery exist—religious, spiritual, and secular (UK Drug Policy Commission, 2008; White, 2007b). The recovery process can involve various forms of external assistance—formal treatment with or without medication assistance, formal peer support networks (e.g., alcoholics anonymous; narcotics anonymous; religious and culturally‑based support groups, peer recovery coaching), or recovery support services (e.g., long‑term care management, employment assistance, and housing support)—or it may involve no external assistance (i.e., unassisted or natural recovery). Kelly et al., (2017) found that among a U.S. national sample of individuals who resolved an alcohol or drug problem, 53.9% reported some form of assisted recovery, and 46.1% reported an unassisted or natural recovery.

The processes underlying SUDs and recovery may differ across various special emphasis populations (SEPs), representing “groups experiencing health disparities resulting in elevated risk to health, safety, and well‑being” (Wagner & Baldwin, 2020, p. 1). SEPs include emerging adults, older adults, women, sexual/gender minorities, racial/ethnic minorities, and individuals with co‑occurring disorders. Differences in the recovery process across SEPs can arise because of heterogeneity in physiological processes, culture, and exposure to social inequalities and disadvantages that may affect access to and the structure, acceptability, and success of various formal and informal treatments for SUDs (e.g., Wagner & Baldwin 2020).

Finally, the stage of recovery will differ across individuals based on the length of recovery and enhanced global functioning: (1) early recovery—1 month to 11 months, (2) sustained recovery—1 to 5 years, and (3) stable recovery—5 or more years (Betty Ford Institute Consensus Panel, 2007; el‑Guebaly, 2012; O’Sullivan et al., 2019; White, 2007a). As the length of recovery increases, the annual risk of SUD recurrence drops substantially. Among those in stable recovery, the annual risk of recurrence approaches the annual risk of developing a SUD in the general population (Kelly et al., 2018).

# Recovery Theme 4: Recovery is Supported by a Chronic Care Model

SUD recovery benefits from embracing a chronic care model (Arria & McLellan, 2012; Sheedy & Whitter, 2009). The traditional acute care model promotes an expectation that single or short‑term episodes of treatment will cure individuals with a SUD, even though such an expectation does not exist for other chronic health problems such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and asthma (McLellan et al., 2000; O’Brien & McLellan, 1996). However, treatment is considered ineffective when the recurrence of symptoms occurs for many individuals in the acute care model. In contrast, a chronic care model acknowledges
