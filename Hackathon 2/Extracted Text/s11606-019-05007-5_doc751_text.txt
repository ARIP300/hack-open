# NEEDS AND OBJECTIVES:

In the wake of the #MeToo movement, it is imperative that the medical field address sexual harassment rapidly to improve the work environment of our physicians and trainees. Little has been done to provide guidance and training on appropriate responses when experiencing or witnessing harassment, leaving many physicians feeling powerless and unsure of how to proceed when such instances do occur. Compounding the difficulty, harassment in medicine comes from a multitude of sources, with patients complicating the traditional colleague hierarchical paradigm. We aimed to develop a workshop providing a repertoire of responses to incidents of experienced and witnessed sexual harassment that participants would find useful and applicable to academic Internal Medicine settings.

# SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS:

The workshop was presented at the Association of Program Directors of Internal Medicine (APDIM) national meeting in Orlando, Florida in October 2018. Approximately 50 participants were in attendance from across the country.

# DESCRIPTION:

We began the workshop with a review of the current data on sexual harassment in medicine. We then reviewed guiding principles and provided a handout of approximately 40 sample responses, organized by situation and source. Examples of responses included "I prefer to be addressed asâ€¦." and "Let's keep things professional." In small groups, participants had the opportunity to develop skills and practice responses to different scenarios including experienced and witnessed instances of sexual harassment, from both patients and colleagues. Evaluations were submitted through the standardized APDIM system.

# EVALUATION:

Twenty-eight evaluations were returned. For "relevance of content to your job," "quality of speaker as a content leader," and "overall satisfaction with the session," participants rated the workshop 4.76, 4.68, and 4.75, respectively (1-5 Likert scale, average for conference 4.40). Free-text comments included: "This was a great session! Being able to walk out with scripts for a variety of situations [as] both a target and observer made the entire conference worthwhile!!! Thank you" and "Challenging, yet clearly and well presented. I have tangible practical takeaways that I am planning to start implementing with my residents. Thank you for doing this!" The content has been requested for dissemination by three institutions.

# DISCUSSION / REFLECTION / LESSONS LEARNED:

The workshop was very well received by all in attendance and promoted lively discussion. Multiple participants expressed the desire to implement these educational methods at their institutions, and formal dissemination is already in process. Continued efforts are needed to incorporate these communication drills into the standard residency curriculum, explore their applicability to other settings, and evaluate their impact on real-life communication skills and confidence.

# TEACHING SAFE AND EFFECTIVE OPIOID PRESCRIBING TO IM CLERKSHIP STUDENTS

# NEEDS AND OBJECTIVES:

Managing acute and chronic pain with opioids should optimally address the morbidity and mortality associated with the opioid epidemic. A 2016 AAMC statement highlighted that for teaching on this topic to be most effective, experiences must be "reinforced throughout the continuum of medical education." Our objective was to update our current IM clerkship curriculum on pain management with evidence-based principles of safe and effective opioid prescribing.

# SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS:

Participants were IM clerkship students at the University of Chicago. The workshop was part of their required didactic experience.

# DESCRIPTION:

A 1-hour case-based workshop was created to discuss concepts that guide chronic opioid prescribing, recognize red flags for opioid misuse, learn how to screen for opioid use disorder, and manage acute pain appropriately. A pre-post survey was administered to assess the impact of the workshop on experiences, knowledge and confidence caring for patients on opioids during the IM clerkship.

# EVALUATION:

Forty-three students have participated in our workshop and completed pre-post surveys (100% response rate). During the IM clerkship, 81% and 75% of students care for patients on acute and chronic opioids respectively once per week or more. Seventy-nine percent cared for patients with opioid use disorder once per month or more. Despite frequent exposure, the majority of students were not familiar with guidelines for prescribing chronic opioids (79%), and not confident in determining appropriate acute pain regimens (90%) and identifying patients at risk for opioid use disorder (60%). On 5-point Likert scales of familiarity and confidence, completion of the curriculum was associated with increases in familiarity with guidelines (2.0 pre, 3.8 post, p <0.0001), confidence in determining acute pain regimens (1.6 pre, 3.4 post, p <0.0001) and identifying patients at risk (2.4 pre, 3.8 post, p <0.0001). Performance on 3 knowledge questions improved from 46%, 11% and 60% correct to 90% (p<0.001), 100% (p<0.001) and 90% correct (p=0.006). Ninety-five percent felt the workshop was helpful in practicing effective opioid prescribing and 98% reported gaining new knowledge.

# DISCUSSION / REFLECTION / LESSONS LEARNED:

Implementing a workshop for third year medicine clerkship students focused on safe and effective opioid prescribing improved students' knowledge, familiarity and confidence. This limited and feasible curricular innovation shows promise, although more in-depth curricula throughout the continuum will be critical to address the opioid epidemic.

# TEAM-BASED LEARNING: AN AMBULATORY CURRICULUM TO INSTILL COMPETITION, FUN, AND SELF-DIRECTED LEARNING INTO INTERNAL MEDICINE RESIDENCY EDUCATION

# NEEDS AND OBJECTIVES:

Traditional lecture-based didactics are commonly used for educational conferences in internal medicine (IM) residency programs but remain a passive form of learning. Team-based learning (TBL) is commonly used in undergraduate medical education, as it is interactive and it promotes self-directed learning. We created a modified TBL curriculum at our residency program to foster active resident learning and to augment resident knowledge in common ambulatory topics.

# SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS:

All residents (n=68) participated in the TBL ambulatory curriculum at the MetroHealth System IM residency program. The residents follow a "4+1" schedule. During their fifth ambulatory week, residents have an educational half-day. Residents attended a two-hour TBL session during their educational half day. There were up to 18 residents per session. The TBL session occurred every week, and 10 topics rotated throughout the year.
