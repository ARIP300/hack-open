# LEARNING OBJECTIVE #1:

Inquire about sexual history and screen at-risk individuals for sexually transmitted infections.

# LEARNING OBJECTIVE #2:

Assess for potential sexually transmitted infections in patients with evidence soft tissue infection with joint involvement.

# CASE:

A 47 year old female with diabetes presented to the Emergency Department with progressive redness, pain, and swelling of the right foot and left knee over the course of five days. She had extensive erythema and swelling on the right foot as well as left proximal calf, left knee, and left distal thigh. She also experienced pain with flexion of the left knee. On admission she was afebrile and vital signs were stable. CT scan revealed gas along the subcutaneous tissue and deep in the fascial planes of the proximal calf and distal thigh along with joint effusion. Her laboratory studies were significant for an elevated White Blood Count of 28,700. The patient was started on broad spectrum antibiotics and was evaluated by a general surgeon. She was taken to the Operating Room for incision and debridement to rule out necrotizing fasciitis. The surgeon noted extensive induration of the posterior calf and thigh with serous fluid without evidence of necrosis or purulence along the fascial planes. The debrided subcutaneous tissue from the Operating Room was sent to the laboratory for culture and returned with gram negative diplococci, that was later confirmed to be Neisseria Gonorrhea. Upon further assessment, the patient stated she was sexually active with multiple male partners and had inconsistent condom use in the past year. She was unsure of her last screening for sexually transmitted infections. She denied any symptoms of urethritis or vaginal discharge. Her urine gonococcal and chlamydia screen was negative, however, the patient had already received five days of IV Ceftriaxone which likely eliminated the infection prior to urine screening.

# IMPACT/DISCUSSION:

This case highlights a unique clinical finding that has scarcely been described in the literature. Given the patient's sexual history and lack of screening, she likely had an untreated gonococcal infection for an unknown period of time. We diagnosed her with severe cellulitis related to disseminated Neisseria gonorrhea infection. This highlights the importance of adequate sexual history taking in all sexually active patients as well as screening those at-risk individuals to prevent severe and life-threatening complications of untreated infections.

# CONCLUSION:

Gonococcal cellulitis is an extremely rare clinical finding that has been scarcely reported in the literature. Screening at-risk individuals for sexually transmitted infections can prevent detrimental complications of untreated infection.

# A RARE CASE OF INVASIVE NON-TYPHOIDAL SALMONELLA CAUSING EMPHYSEMATOUS OSTEOMYELITIS

# LEARNING OBJECTIVE #1:

We present a rare case of emphysematous vertebral osteomyelitis due to Non-typhoidal salmonella (NTS) in an immunocompetent adult. NTS commonly causes foodborne diarrheal illness but rarely causes fulminant invasive infections. There is a six fold higher risk of invasive infection with NTS when compared with other bacterial causes of gastroenteritis. There should always be a high degree of suspicion in presence of particular risk factors which would aid in reducing morbidity and mortality.

# CASE:

Our patient is a 51-year-old male who presented to the ED in acute distress with worsening back pain for four weeks. Associated symptoms included shortness of breath, sharp chest pain, high grade fever, and chills. His significant medical history included type II diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and peripheral vascular disease. His medications were aspirin, cilostazol, insulin glargine, losartan, and fenofibrate. He had a 30-pack year smoking history but denied any illicit drug use. He owned a mobile petting zoo and was in close contact with many animals on a daily basis. Examination revealed oxygen saturation of 84% on room air, bilaterally diminished breath sounds, and point tenderness around the first lumbar vertebra. His laboratory studies were significant for platelet count of 103, ESR of 88, sodium of 129, creatinine of 1.94, and total bilirubin of 1.7. Blood cultures were drawn. Chest x-ray showed bilateral extensive multifocal airspace opacities, and an MRI of spine showed emphysematous osteomyelitis of the L1 vertebral body with small amounts of gas in the retroperitoneum. The patient was started on supplemental oxygen, vancomycin, cefepime, and levofloxacin. Over the next two days, his oxygen requirement increased, and he eventually required non-invasive ventilation in the ICU. On day four, blood cultures grew gram negative rods which finalized to pansensitive group D salmonella. He was treated with intravenous ceftriaxone for six weeks. Neurosurgical intervention was deemed unnecessary, as there were no signs of necrosis or abscess formation on serial imaging. At three-month follow up, the patient reported complete resolution of his symptoms.

# IMPACT/DISCUSSION:

Extraintestinal infections of NTS species are well reported in immunocompromised patients; however, they are rare in immunocompetent patients such as ours. Invasive NTS is also associated with diabetes and atherosclerosis. Along with our patient's comorbidities, repeated exposure to animals in his petting zoo likely culminated in his extraintestinal, invasive infection. Due to disease rarity, management of emphysematous osteomyelitis can prove difficult as optimal antibiotics and the need for surgery have not yet been established. Although there has been development in the field of invasive NTS vaccines, none have shown much promise in clinical trials.

# CONCLUSION:

There should be an increased awareness amongst physicians to reduce morbidity associated with NTS emphysematous osteomyelitis.

# A RARE CASE OF LIFE-THREATENING HYPONATREMIA FROM A SWOLLEN HEART

Shaunak Mulani; Margaret C. Lo. University of Florida College of Medicine, Gainesville, FL. (Control ID #3185939)

# LEARNING OBJECTIVE #1:

Recognize the clinical presentation of acute hyponatremia secondary to pericardial tamponade.

# LEARNING OBJECTIVE #2:

Identify the risk factors and disease markers for acute hyponatremia secondary to tamponade.

# CASE:

A 76-year-old female presented with three weeks of lightheadedness, substernal, non-radiating chest pain and self-reported syncopal episodes. Medical history includes rheumatoid arthritis and GERD. Exam revealed tachypnea, hypotension, irregularly irregular rhythm and rate (140s), jugular venous distension and 1+ pitting edema in bilateral legs. EKG showed new onset atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate (RVR). CBC, BMP and TSH were normal on admission. ProNT BNP was elevated at 408. CTA Chest noted a moderately sized pericardial effusion but no PE. TTE showed a newly depressed EF of 35% and a pericardial effusion but no tamponade physiology. Patient was stabilized by diuresis for CHF and metoprolol for rate control. On hospital days 4-6, she developed worsening dyspnea, increasing hypoxia, recurrent hypotension refractory to IVF and atrial fibrillation with RVR refractory to IV metoprolol and digoxin. Labs noted acute kidney injury (AKI) and acute hypotonic hyponatremia worsening in 48 hours (creatinine 1.1- >2.1 mg/dl, Na 136->122mEq). The hyponatremia did not respond to fluid restriction or salt tablets. Repeat TTE showed worsening pericardial effusion with tamponade physiology. Urgent pericardiocentesis removed
