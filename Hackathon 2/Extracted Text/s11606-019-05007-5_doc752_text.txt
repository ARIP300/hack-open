# ABSTRACTS

# DESCRIPTION:

Each TBL session reviewed a common ambulatory topic. One week prior to each TBL session, residents received a relevant article to read based on the topic of the week (known in TBL as pre-class preparation). At the start of each TBL session, each resident completed a timed-quiz related to the topic, similar in format to the ABIM exam (individual readiness assurance test). The residents were then assigned to a team, to discuss the same questions to reach consensus answers (readiness assurance test). Following this, the facilitator led an inter-team discussion of the questions. Finally, a clinical vignette based on the topic was presented with questions for team discussion. Points were given to teams for each correct answer. Each session had a total number of points possible, and points were tracked for the all teams throughout the academic year. The point system is a modification from traditional TBL, as grades were not instituted.

# EVALUATION:

We administered anonymous surveys prior to the TBL sessions to all resident participants, measuring resident perceptions of lecture-based versus TBL-based teaching methods. Three months after the implementation of the TBL curriculum, we conducted post-TBL surveys to the same participants to gauge resident completion of pre-class reading assignments and their perception of TBL.

# DISCUSSION / REFLECTION / LESSONS LEARNED:

Most residents agreed or strongly agreed (93% to 98%) that TBL was well-suited to their learning style, felt engaged during the TBL sessions, and believed that TBL improved their clinical decision-making skills. The majority of residents (96% to 98%) also reported that this method nurtured positive interactions between peers. This study showed that most residents (87%) completed the pre-lecture reading most or all of the time, with the most common reason of self-directed reading as "being a valuable team player." Our data demonstrates that TBL is an effective teaching format to improve resident engagement in didactic sessions, team work, and motivation for self-directed learning.

# NEEDS AND OBJECTIVES:

Effective community engagement enables physicians to collaborate with populations to improve health. To address these barriers to in residency training to learn about community engagement we created a chief resident position geared towards advocacy and community engagement and function as nidus for curricular and community-based experiential innovations. In 2015, we designed a novel position, Chief Resident for Advocacy and Community Health. The objectives for this chief resident are to: collaborate with the community to better understand local priorities, develop an integrated curriculum for physician advocacy and social justice, serve as a mentor to residents interested in advocacy and community engagement projects.

# SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS:

The setting is an academic medical center-based internal medicine-primary care residency program located in a mid-size northeast city. The local community is made up of a majority racial/ethnic minorities with ~25% living below the poverty line. The majority of patients served by the resident practice have Medicaid.

# DESCRIPTION:

The novel chief resident position, an addition to the existing chief resident group, was created with funding provided by the sponsoring institution. Primary roles include working with faculty to develop and co-lead a three-year, mandatory, longitudinal community engagement and advocacy curriculum, develop a conference series on social justice topics, and function as a liaison between housestaff and the community. The chief resident also collaborates with non-profit organizations, and actively fosters relationships with community through regular attendance at community meetings. In addition, the chief resident shares clinical, administrative and teaching responsibilities with the other chief residents. The chief resident also delivers a grand rounds to the Department of Medicine on an advocacy or community engagement topic. The chief resident also leads a committee of residents to facilitate and mentor residents in self-directed advocacy projects such as collaboration with local farm programs around health promotion and local providers of diabetes prevention programs. At the end of the 2018-2019 academic year, four individuals will have served in this role.

# EVALUATION:

The creation of this position has resulted in an expansion of curricular offerings on community engagement and advocacy, including specific knowledge of community-based resources. The chief residents' collaboration with faculty supporting this role has also enhanced the continuity and depth of relationships with community organizations despite the transient nature of residency training.

# DISCUSSION / REFLECTION / LESSONS LEARNED:

Our residency program has successfully integrated a Chief Resident in Advocacy and Community Health. Through this role, the residency has fostered a deeper understanding of the community which has helped to inform and guide care in the clinic. The position has also provided additional support for residents interested in advocacy, community engagement and social justice.

# NEEDS AND OBJECTIVES:

Medical students and residents often recite the Hippocratic Oath (or its equivalent) at their white coat ceremonies. Oaths enjoin physicians to care for patients with sincerity, empathy and kindness. Some have suggested that these same values should apply to the physician's self-care as well. That is, repurposing the Hippocratic Oath to emphasize a reciprocal interaction benefiting the servant and the served. Given the alarming prevalence of physician burnout, there is a growing need for resilience training in medical education. Medical education often includes texts in the form of case studies as a way to develop ethical reasoning and diagnostic skills. Building resilience requires similar explicit training. Our work showcases the Hippocratic Oath as a text repurposed to enhance professional wellbeing and undergird ethical and compassionate practice.

# SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS:

We will share our curriculum, The Art of Balance: Caring for Physician and Patient, which is designed to build physician resiliency by emphasizing teamwork, reflection and empathy as catalysts for overcoming physician burnout.

# DESCRIPTION:

The Art of Balance: Caring for Physician and Patient was developed in partnership among The University of Tennessee, Hunter Art Museum Southeast Center for Art Education. There is practical emphasis on developing strategies for overcoming physician burnout. Sessions are comprised of two to three main sections: group engagement and discussion with a work of art; a transitional activity involving individual museum exploration or small group activity; reflective collaboration on a creative prompt. This presentation unpacks a sample session and how the program supports varying needs related to physician burnout.

# EVALUATION:

This program has served over 150 learners. Each session has a theme but remains organic and responsive to learner needs as they.
