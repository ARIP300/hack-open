# Mechanical Tricuspid Valve Thrombosis

of all leaflets, concerning for prosthetic valve thrombosis. Fluoroscopy was performed and revealed minimal motion of the mechanical leaflets, confirming the diagnosis. She received thrombolytic therapy with tissue plasminogen activator and had subsequent resolution of symptoms. Repeat echocardiogram showed resolution of regurgitation and stenosis. She was discharged on therapeutic Warfarin.

# IMPACT/DISCUSSION:

This case illustrates the diagnosis and successful management of mechanical tricuspid valve thrombosis. Although there is extensive literature on left-sided prosthetic valvular thrombosis, there is little published and no current guidelines on this same phenomenon for right-sided prosthetic valve thrombosis. The case highlights how different imaging modalities are crucial in confirming the diagnosis. It also demonstrates successful management of this under-reported clinical situation. Limited data suggest that thrombolytic therapy is effective for these patients, as demonstrated by this case. With the rise of the opiate epidemic with concomitant increase in prevalence of infectious endocarditis necessitating heart valve replacement, the investigation into this condition is certainly warranted. The case also highlights flaws in our correctional system. The majority of cases of prosthetic valve thrombosis are due to subtherapeutic anticoagulation, and in this case was directly attributable to the withholding of medication during incarceration. It certainly calls for improvements in the medical management of incarcerated patients.

# CONCLUSION:

Mechanical tricuspid valve endocarditis is a rare clinical presentation that warrants further investigation. Incarcerated patients are at risk for inappropriate medical management that may lead to serious complications.

# MEDIASTINAL GERM CELL TUMOR (MGCT) AS INITIAL PRESENTATION OF KLINEFELTER SYNDROME (KS)

Sarah S. Roderick; Aaron R. Kaufman; Cara Guenther. Boston Medical Center, Boston, MA. (Control ID #3165765)

# LEARNING OBJECTIVE #1:

Recognize cough, dyspnea, fevers, and weight loss as presenting symptoms of a mGCT in a young and healthy patient.

# LEARNING OBJECTIVE #2:

Recognize the relationship between KS and the elevated risk of mGCT.

# CASE:

A 23-year-old man with no prior medical history presented with three months of cough, fevers, chills, night sweats, weight loss and pleuritic chest pain. The patient had immigrated from Colombia ten years ago and was recently exposed to tuberculosis (TB). His exam were notable for mild tachycardia and absent breath sounds in the left lung fields. Chest CT identified a large anterior mediastinal mass with central necrosis, compressive left lung atelectasis, and lateral displacement of the heart and mediastinum. PET CT showed hypermetabolic activity of the mass, the L2 and L4 vertebrae, and multiple lymph node chains. Labs demonstrated a negative interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA) and HIV, normal beta-HCG, and an elevated AFP. The mass was biopsied and pathology was consistent with yolk sac tumor. On testicular exam, the patient was noted to have small testes. Given recent diagnosis of a mGCT, suspicion was increased for underlying KS. Subsequent scrotal ultrasound visualized small volume testes. Labs showed an elevated FSH and LH, low testosterone, and normal estradiol and prolactin. Further testing demonstrated a 47,XXY karyotype, confirming diagnosis of KS. The patient was initiated on ifosfamide/etoposide/cisplatin (VIP). He was subsequently discharged with plan for three additional chemotherapy cycles along with surgical evaluation for possible resection of the remaining mass.

# IMPACT/DISCUSSION:

With a new diagnosis of mGCT in a young and healthy patient with small testes, it is important to consider the association between KS and increased risk of mGCT.

# CONCLUSION:

Given symptoms of cough, dyspnea, fevers, night sweats, pleuritic chest pain, and weight loss in an otherwise young and healthy individual from Colombia, TB is high on the differential. However, given the patient's negative IGRA and large mediastinal mass seen on imaging, it's also important not to miss malignancy. In young adult men, the most common type of mediastinal malignancies is GCT, including nonseminomatous GCT, with yolk sac tumors being the most common. An elevated AFP is present in a majority of patients, while a small minority present with an elevated B-hCG. GCT tends to be metastatic on presentation; therefore, treatment is with chemotherapy (VIP) followed by resection of any residual mass. Prior literature has illustrated that patients with KS are at an elevated risk of developing GCT. The classic phenotype includes tall stature, gynecomastia, small testes, and psychosocial impairments. Interestingly in our patient with karyotype-confirmed diagnosis, the only phenotypic finding was small testes. Identification of KS has importance for fertility counseling, especially in the setting of pre-chemotherapy decision-making (e.g. sperm banking).

# MELANOMAS MASQUERADING AS LIPOMAS, AND THE MORBID CONSEQUENCES

Matthew Lipinski1; Diane Hershock2. 1Penn State University at Hershey Medical Center, Hummelstown, PA; 2Penn State University at Hershey Medical Center, Hershey, PA. (Control ID #3185560)

# LEARNING OBJECTIVE #1:

Describe the variety of clinical presentations of melanoma.

# LEARNING OBJECTIVE #2:

Discuss the prognosis and treatment for metastatic melanoma.

# CASE:

A 22 year-old woman presented with several months of multiple progressively enlarging subcutaneous nodules. The week prior to admission, she had also developed diplopia and nausea. She does not go outside often, and uses sunscreen when she does. Two siblings have had biopsy-proven lipomas in the past. There is no history of skin cancer in her family. On physical exam, she had multiple small flesh-colored, freely mobile nodules with irregular borders that were present on her right axilla, left arm, back, and chest wall. There was a large five centimeter flesh-colored nodule on her right scalp. There were two one centimeter blue-pigmented nodules in her left axilla. Skin biopsy of a nodule revealed metastatic melanoma. MRI of her brain revealed a four centimeter lesion in the right occipital lobe with radiographic signs of metastatic melanoma.

# IMPACT/DISCUSSION:

Skin lesions are encountered frequently by internists, and are a common reason for patients to make an appointment. Superficial spreading melanoma presents as intensely dark macules with irregular borders on the skin surface. This is by far the most common type of melanoma, therefore many physicians associate melanoma only with this presentation. However, melanomas can have multiple colors, or be non-pigmented and resemble subcutaneous nodules. Nodular melanoma, especially when skin-colored, usually has the worst prognosis; this is partly due to delay in recognition. The ABCDEs of melanoma (asymmetry, border irregularity, color abnormalities, large diameter, enlarging rapidly) can be applied to any concerning skin lesion. Any rapidly growing skin lesion warrants a discussion with the patient about potential biopsy. Metastatic melanoma portends a very poor prognosis for patients. Treatments have evolved from the prior poorly efficacious chemotherapy, and now center around immunotherapy with inhibitors of CTLA-4 and the PD-1 receptor. Despite these advances, the overall average prognosis is still approximately two years.

# CONCLUSION:

Due to its many possible clinical presentations and high morbidity and mortality, internists need to have a high clinical suspicion for melanoma when presented with abnormal skin findings. Treatment options have improved but overall survival is still very poor.
