important topic for researchers and practitioners alike. In this regard, it is timely to explore the impact of work stress on SME problems of survival and growth during emergency events like the COVID-19 pandemic.

Although recent studies have demonstrated the relationship between work stress and employee performance, some insufficiencies persist, which must be resolved. Research on how work stress affects employee performance has remained fragmented and limited. First, the research into how work stress affects employee performance is still insufficient. Some researchers have explored the effects of work stress on employee performance during COVID-19 (Saleem et al., 2021; Tu et al., 2021). However, they have not explained the intermediate path, which limits our understanding of effects of work stress. As work stress causes psychological pain to employees, in response, they exhibit lower performance levels (Song et al., 2020; Yu et al., 2022). Thus, employees’ mental health becomes an important path to explain the relationship mechanism between work stress and employee performance, which is revealed in this study using a stress–psychological state–performance framework. Second, resolving the mental health problems caused by work stress has become a key issue for SMEs during the COVID-19 pandemic. As the core of the enterprise (Ahn et al., 2018), the behavior of leaders significantly influences employees. Especially for SMEs, intensive interactive communication transpires between the leader and employees (Li et al., 2019; Tiedtke et al., 2020). Servant leadership, as a typical leader’s behavior, is considered an important determinant of employee mental health (Haslam et al., 2020). Hence, to improve employees’ mental health, we introduce servant leadership as a moderating variable and explore its contingency effect on relieving work stress and mental health.

This study predominantly tries to answer the question of how work stress influences employee performance and explores the mediating impact of mental health and the moderating impact of servant leadership in this relationship. Mainly, this study contributes to the existing literature in the following three ways: First, this research analyzes the influence of work stress on employee performance in SMEs during the COVID-19 pandemic, which complements previous studies and theories related to work stress. Second, this study regards mental health as a psychological state and examines its mediating impact on the relationship between work stress and employee performance, which complements the research path on how work stress affects employee performance. Third, we explore the moderating impact of servant leadership, which has been ignored in previous research, thus extending the understanding of the relationship between the work stress and mental health of employees in SMEs.

To accomplish the aforementioned tasks, the remainder of this article is structured as follows: First, based on the literature review, we propose our hypotheses. Thereafter, we present our research method, including the processes of data collection, sample characteristics, measurement of variables, and sample validity. Subsequently, we provide the data analysis and report the results. Finally, we discuss the results and present the study limitations.

# Theoretical background and hypotheses

# Work stress and employee performance

From a psychological perspective, work stress influences employees’ psychological states, which, in turn, affects their effort levels at work (Lu, 1997; Richardson and Rothstein, 2008; Lai et al., 2022). Employee performance is the result of the individual’s efforts at work (Robbins, 2005) and thus is significantly impacted by work stress. However, previous research has provided no consistent conclusion regarding the relationship between work stress and employee performance. One view is that a significant positive relationship exists between work stress and employee performance (Ismail et al., 2015; Soomro et al., 2019), suggesting that stress is a motivational force that encourages employees to work hard and improve work efficiency. Another view is that work stress negatively impacts employee performance (Yunus et al., 2018; Nawaz Kalyar et al., 2019; Purnomo et al., 2021), suggesting that employees need to spend time and energy to cope with stress, which increases their burden and decreases their work efficiency. A third view is that the impact of work stress on employee performance is non-linear and may exhibit an inverted U-shaped relationship (McClenahan et al., 2007; Hamidi and Eivazi, 2010); reportedly, when work stress is relatively low or high, employee performance is low. Hence, if work stress reaches a moderate level, employee performance will peak. However, this conclusion is derived from theoretical analyses and is not supported by empirical data. Finally, another view suggests that no relationship exists between them (T˘an˘asescu and Ramona-Diana, 2019). Indubitably, it presupposes that employees are rational beings (Lebesby and Benders, 2020). Per this view, work stress cannot motivate employees or influence their psychology and thus cannot impact their performance.

To further explain the aforementioned diverse views, positive psychology proposes that work stress includes two main categories: challenge stress and hindrance stress (Cavanaugh et al., 2000; LePine et al., 2005). Based on their views, challenge stress represents stress that positively affects employees’ work attitudes and behaviors, which improves employee performance by increasing work responsibility; by contrast, hindrance stress negatively affects employees’ work attitudes and behaviors, which reduces employee performance by increasing role ambiguity (Hon and Chan, 2013; Deng et al., 2019).

During the COVID-19 pandemic, SMEs have faced a relatively higher risk of salary reductions, layoffs, or corporate
