# Philosophy of Management

# Conclusion

Anderson’s main task was to bring the problem of business’s culture of dominance to the fore, to help cure us of our philosophical hemiagnosia. “My lectures aim to expose [the] reality” of “the actual subjection of most workers to private government,” Anderson writes, though she adds: “I do not propose to solve the question of what the best workplace constitution ought to be” (pp. 132, 133). Similarly, our discussion has not detailed what an appropriate remedy would entail, but we have suggested that neither Smith’s suggestion of teaching workers to “read, write, and account” nor Anderson’s suggestion to give already acculturated workers with vitiated judgment “voice” in the workplace would suffice.

If we care about workers’ welfare, and if we wish to fulfill Smith’s “deeply humane vision” of a society whose institutions are designed to enable people to lead fulfilling and flourishing lives of freedom, then this is an issue we must take seriously and address (publicly or privately) for workers who spend so much of their time in the culture of business. Becoming aware of this culture’s potentially negative effects would be the necessary first step, which Anderson is right to bring to our attention. But if she is correct about the pervasively deleterious effects engendered by the oppressive cultures of many businesses, and if Smith is right about the dependence of our preferences, judgment, and even personalities on our environmental and cultural influences, then the real work required to develop appropriate institutions to address these effects is not only necessary but, alas, remains to be done.18
