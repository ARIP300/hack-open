# CONCLUSION:

- The "widowhood effect" is a universal health phenomenon.
- There are many risk factors that may contribute to poor quality of life in older adults after the death of a partner.
- Healthcare providers must take on an active role in supporting vulnerable individuals during times of grief.

# TWO DAY OLD STEMI? WITH LUPUS ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE

Ammar Hasnie; Usman Hasnie; James Stanford; Agostino Molteni. UMKC, Kansas City, MO. (Control ID #3185736)

# LEARNING OBJECTIVE #1:

Recognize the varied clinical manifestations of Lupus; more specifically Antiphospholipid Antibody Syndrome

# CASE:

A 37-year-old female with a past medical history of Hypertension, Ischemic Cardiomyopathy (EF=40-45%), Systemic Lupus Erythematosus, and Antiphospholipid Antibody Syndrome presented to the Emergency Department with complaints of pleuritic chest pain that had been persistent for two days duration which radiated down her left arm. Initial laboratory workup noted a normal BMP & CBC. Troponin was noted to be elevated at 0.25 ng/mL. Lipid profile (LDL=72) was within normal limits as was A1C (5.3). Initial ECG was concerning for ST-elevation MI in the lateral leads (V2-V4) with no bundle branch block. Chest X-ray was unremarkable, however bedside ECHO noted a depressed ejection fraction of 40% with wall motion abnormality in the distribution of the LAD (left anterior descending). A CT-Angiogram of the chest was performed to rule out aortic dissection. The patient was emergently transferred to the cardiac cath lab for percutaneous coronary intervention with drug-eluting stent placement. Cardiac cath noted a mid-LAD lesion that was 99% occluded. She tolerated the procedure well and was discharged to home on Ticagrelor and Aspirin.

# IMPACT/DISCUSSION:

Systemic Lupus Erythematosus is notoriously known for being the "great imitator" due to its ability to affect any organ system. Antiphospholipid Antibody syndrome commonly presents in the setting of Lupus and is associated with the formation of vascular thrombosis. In this case, the patient waited two days before receiving medical attention. A large retrospective analysis showed Antiphospholipid Syndrome was responsible for 100,000 of myocardial infarctions (MIs) in the United States annually, or nearly 4% of MIs. Given the patient in this case had no obvious traditional risk factors, a delay in diagnosis and treatment could have been fatal given her delay in seeking care. A high index of suspicion of life threatening thrombosis is critical in these patients for the potential for favorable outcome.

# CONCLUSION:

Antiphospholipid Antibody Syndrome is a systemic autoimmune disease characterized by a hypercoagulable state commonly associated with recurrent pregnancy loss. However, there are other common clinical manifestations ranging from neurological involvement to cardiac involvement. Antiphospholipid antibodies have an ability to induce endothelial activation which can ultimately lead to development of accelerated atherosclerosis. We present a case of an otherwise healthy young female presenting with a myocardial infarction secondary to her antiphospholipid antibody syndrome due to plaque rupture in her mid-left anterior descending artery.

# TWO DROPS

Letisha Ferris; Michael P. Smith. University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE. (Control ID #3185746)

# LEARNING OBJECTIVE #1:

Identify the three disease phases of Eosinophilic Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (EGPA)

# LEARNING OBJECTIVE #2:

Understand the complications of EGPA

# CASE:

A 53 year-old woman presented with bilateral foot drop. She reported one-month history of progressive clumsiness and a weak hand grip. Symptoms began with a painful rash on her feet. She denied fatigue, myalgia, arthralgia, confusion, dizziness, or loss of bowel or bladder function. She denied recent illness or travel. Past medical history included adult-onset allergic sinusitis and asthma refractory to conventional management. Lung imaging with patchy opacities. Multiple sinus surgeries with tissue biopsies noted eosinophilic infiltration. Screening for ANCA twelve years prior was negative. She had no personal or family history of diabetes or neuromuscular diseases. She had never smoked and drank alcohol occasionally. She had weak flexion and extension in her feet and flexion in her wrists. Ankle reflexes were diminished. Sensation to light touch, pinprick, and vibration were diminished in lower extremities. Proprioception was diminished in her great toes. Temperature sense was intact. She exhibited an ataxic gait and was unable to walk on tip-toes or heels. Foot drop was present bilaterally. She had eosinophilia with an absolute count of 14,600/mL and 65 percent predominance, along with elevated CRP and ESR, trace hematuria, and a positive ANA and p-ANCA. EMG revealed axonal asymmetric sensorimotor neuropathy. Hemoglobin A1c and TSH were unremarkable. Infectious work-up was negative, as were vitamin levels, brain and cervical spine MRI, electrocardiogram, and echocardiogram. She actually met diagnostic criteria for EGPA years prior to presentation.

# IMPACT/DISCUSSION:

EGPA (formerly Churg-Strauss) is a vasculitis of small and medium sized vessels characterized by allergic rhinitis, asthma, and peripheral eosinophilia. It occurs in 18 out of every 1,000,000 people and accounts for 10 percent of vasculitis cases. It is associated with p-ANCA in approximately 50 percent of cases but it is not part of the diagnostic criteria. The diagnostic criteria for EGPA require four of the following to be present: paranasal sinus abnormalities, asthma, non-fixed pulmonary opacities on radiography, greater than 10 percent eosinophils, biopsy revealing extravascular eosinophils, and mononeuropathy or polyneuropathy. EGPA classically presents in three sequential phases. Atopy is representative of the prodromal phase. Peripheral eosinophilia and eosinophilic infiltration of organs, most notably the lungs, is characteristic of the eosinophilic phase. The vasculitic phase commonly manifests as neuropathy, most specifically mononeuritis multiplex, but it may give rise to serious extra-pulmonary complications that account for the majority of mortality in EGPA.

# CONCLUSION:

It is essential that internists are able to recognize EGPA as early as possible in the disease course to prevent the development of the irreversible vasculitic stage and the associated extra-pulmonary complications.

# TYPE 1 OR TYPE 2 DIABETES? A YOUNG, ASYMPTOMATIC MALE WITH A NORMAL BMI, FOUND TO HAVE SEVERE TYPE 2 DIABETES WITH END ORGAN DAMAGE
