# BACKGROUND

Shared medical group interventions have been shown to improve outcomes among patients with a common disease or disorder. We sought to determine if a group prevention intervention based on problem-solving theory could reduce cardiovascular risk among patients at risk for cardiovascular disease but without a common risk factor.

# METHODS

Patients at 2 VA Medical Centers with at least 5% 10-year risk of a major cardiovascular event as measured by Framingham Risk Score (FRS), and with at least 2% of that risk reversible, were randomized to Group Prevention Coaching (GPC) vs. usual care (UC). GPC comprised 6 group visits among 5-15 patients and 6 individual telephone calls over 18 weeks; the content was derived from Problem Solving Therapy. The group leader, a clinical psychologist, taught patients core skills to improve at least one risk behavior, usually by healthier eating, increasing physical activity, or smoking cessation. Group session content was reinforced with individual telephone calls between each patient and a healthcare coach trained in motivational interviewing. In group visits and individual calls, patients set SMART goals and discussed barriers to achieving these goals along with solutions to these barriers. Primary outcome was FRS; secondary outcomes included the Patient Activation Measure (PAM), range 0-100 points, and the Social Problem Solving Inventory (SPSI), range 0-139 points. We analyzed differences between GPC and UC at 6 months using an intention-to-treat approach and linear mixed models (LMM), adjusting for group clustering in the GPC arm.

# RESULTS

We randomized 202 patients to GPC and 199 to usual care. Mean age was 62.4 years, 10% were women, and 32% were black. Mean 10-year risk of cardiovascular event was 29.2% by FRS; baseline mean PAM and SPSI scores were 60 and 105, respectively. Follow-up rate at 6 months was 62% in GPC and 64% in usual care. GPC patients attended a mean of 3.4 (of 6) group sessions; 43.6% attended 5 or 6 groups, and 14.9% did not attend any. Patients completed a mean of 3.9 (of 6 calls); 57.4% completed 5 or 6 calls, and 14.4% completed no calls. Among GPC patients, 47.7% chose to work on improved eating or weight loss, 17.9% chose to increase physical activity, 27.8% chose to quit smoking, and 6.6% chose another strategy for improving risk (medication adherence or cessation of non-tobacco substance). In the LMM analyses, there was no difference at 6 months between GPC and UC patients in FRS (mean difference 0.7%, 95% CI, -1.4%, 2.8%), PAM score (mean differences 1.3 points, 95% CI -1.3, 3.9), or SPSI (mean difference 1.6 points, 95% CI -1.4, 4.0).

# BACKGROUND

Approximately 2/3 of all inmates in the Los Angeles County (LAC) jail system suffer from substance use disorder, predominantly alcohol-related, and many will experience forced withdrawal following incarceration. Jail facilities often lack standardized methods for identifying patients who are in alcohol withdrawal or at risk of withdrawing, and treatment is commonly de-centralized, resulting in significant mortality and morbidity. In an effort to mitigate adverse outcomes associated with alcohol withdrawal in custody, the LAC jail system established a pilot detoxification (detox) unit and developed a novel triage-to-treatment pathway to identify incoming patients in acute or subacute alcohol withdrawal; treat using the evidence-based CIWA protocol; and refer for Medication Assisted Treatment (MAT). Our study aims to present preliminary clinical effectiveness data for this pathway.

# METHODS

This hybrid effectiveness/implementation study uses a quasi-experimental design to compare data from an intervention site (LAC men's jail) and a control site that has not implemented the pathway or detox unit (LAC women's jail). Our study population includes males age 18 who present to jail with a reported alcohol use history and a CIWA score >8 or alcohol consumption within the prior 72 hours; and incarcerated females age 18 who were treated with the CIWA protocol. Variables include time from jail intake to first treatment dose; incidence of decompensated withdrawal; and number of referrals for MAT. Preliminary data were collected via chart abstraction of 5% of all patients admitted to the detox unit (intervention site) or treated with CIWA (control site) between June 2018 to November 2018.

# RESULTS

Of 454 charts reviewed, 20% of patients were female and 80% were male. There was no statistical difference between intervention and control sites in the mean CIWA score on initial presentation (3.74, 95% CI [3.42, 4.05] versus 3.80, 95% CI [3.20, 4.40]), or the proportion of patients admitted to the detox unit that had one or more CIWA scores >8 (19.6% versus 20.7%, p=0.48). However, there was a significant difference between the intervention and control site in the proportion of patients who had 2 or more scores >8 during treatment (9.4% vs 4.3%, p<0.052). Ninety-seven percent of patients at the intervention site received an initial treatment dose within 24 hours of intake compared to 71% at the control site (p<0.001). Over the 5 month study period, 3 patients from the intervention site were transferred to the hospital for decompensated withdrawal, compared to 0 patients from the control site. Thirty-three percent of patients at the control site were referred for MAT, and none from the control site.

# CONCLUSIONS

Preliminary results suggest that the pathway effectively expedites identification and treatment of suspected alcohol withdrawal and increases MAT referrals. Future analyses will explore acceptability and feasibility of this pathway.
