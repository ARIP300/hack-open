Despite a lack of systematic research on the association of workplace substance use norms and rituals to the SUD recovery process, research in the addictions area shows that general social norms and social pressure can undermine recovery by increasing posttreatment recurrence of substance use (Marlatt & George, 1984; Ramo & Brown, 2008; Strowig, 2000; Tucker et al., 1991; Yong et al., 2018) and reducing the likelihood and frequency of attending peer support groups offering long‑term recovery support (e.g., Alcoholics Anonymous, Narcotics Anonymous) (Davey‑Rothwell et al., 2008).

# Research Proposition 3

Workplace social norms and work‑related rituals that support substance use will decrease the likelihood of (a) initiating unassisted and treatment‑assisted recovery efforts, (b) achieving or sustaining abstinence, and (c) achieving broad recovery outcomes such as growth in positive recovery capital and improved physical, psychological, and social well‑being.

# Stigma

Stigma represents a personal attribute or label (e.g., addict, alcoholic, drunk, druggie, stoner), conveying that a person possesses a fundamental and profoundly discrediting flaw (Goffman, 1963). This perception of a flaw leads to a set of negative attributions and stereotypes concerning those with a SUD, such as being perceived to be dangerous, unpredictable, worthless, poorly motivated, failing to meet primary role responsibilities, unemployable, solely responsible for one’s condition, unable to gain control of one’s life, and morally deficient (National Academies of Sciences‑Engineering‑Medicine, 2016a; Nieweglowski et al., 2018; Schomerus et al., 2011; van Boekel et al., 2013; Yang et al., 2017). These negative perceptions can lead to prejudice, discrimination, harassment, social exclusion, limited opportunities to participate fully in employment and other life roles, reduced public financial support for SUDs treatment, and increased support for legally coerced treatment (Hinshaw & Stier, 2008; Krupa et al., 2009; Roche et al., 2019; Schomerus et al., 2011; Stuart, 2004).

Research also demonstrates that SUDs are highly stigmatized compared with other psychiatric disorders (major depression, schizophrenia) by both the general public, including employees and employers, and health professionals (Corrigan & Nieweglowski, 2018; Jorm & Oh, 2009; Lloyd, 2013; National Academies of Sciences‑Engineering‑Medicine, 2016a; Nieweglowski et al., 2018; Roche et al., 2019; Schomerus et al., 2011; van Boekel et al., 2013; Yang et al., 2017).

The stigmatization of SUDs can be rooted in an ingroup/outgroup dehumanization process, where those in the ingroup (individuals without SUDs) often believe that those in the outgroup who possess a stigma (e.g., SUD) lack distinctly human characteristics based on attributions and stereotypes described earlier (Leyens et al., 2000; Schroeder & Epley, 2020). These distinctly human characteristics include mental functioning (e.g., cognition, rationality, self‑control), secondary emotions (e.g., compassion, happiness, shame, remorse, melancholia), and higher‑order psychological needs (self‑esteem, self‑actualization) (Leyens et al., 2000; Schroeder & Epley, 2020).

A study by Schroeder & Epley (2020) illustrates the dehumanization of individuals with SUDs. They asked individuals to rate the importance of three levels of needs for several human targets and one nonhuman primate target. The targets were self, close friend, lawyer, elderly person, child, homeless person, drug addict, and chimpanzee. The three levels
