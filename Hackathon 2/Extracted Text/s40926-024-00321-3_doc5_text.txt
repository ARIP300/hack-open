# Smith on Business Unfreedom

Smith provides considerable support for Anderson’s argument elsewhere in WN, especially in the discussion of how extreme division of labor truncates workers’ character and intellect. As we argue in §§ 2–3, the contributions of Smith (1723–1790) remain alive and well in their application to today’s evolving commercial society. Perhaps the single best way to understand the dominance dynamic of contemporary business is, in fact, to draw on Smith’s seminal insights.

For Smith, the worker, whose whole life is spent in performing a few simple operations, of which the effects too are, perhaps, always the same, or very nearly the same, has no occasion to exert his understanding, or to exercise his invention in finding out expedients for removing difficulties which never occur. (WN, p. 782)

The effect on such a worker? He “naturally loses, therefore, the habit of such exertion, and generally becomes as stupid and ignorant as it is possible for a human creature to become” (ibid.). Smith goes on at some length describing such a worker’s “torpor of his mind” (ibid.), his “drowsy stupidity” (WN, p. 783), and his “mental mutilation, deformity, and wretchedness” (WN, p. 787). A more strongly worded condemnation is scarcely imaginable. It is to alleviate some measure of this “mental mutilation” that Smith entertains the possibility of partial state provision of primary education—at a minimum, what is necessary to give everyone “the most essential parts of education,” namely, “to read, write, and account” (WN, p. 785).

Smith’s description of what extreme division of labor does to workers is dramatic, and perhaps exaggerated—is it ever the case that a person’s “whole life is spent performing [only] a few simple operations”? Yet, some firms are, for example, incentivized to keep workers mono-focused on single, simple tasks so as to avoid inefficient time losses in switching between tasks (cf. WN, bk. 1, Chap. 1). The gravamen of Smith’s worry thus concerns what such an unnatural constriction of human behavior does to a person’s character and judgment. This worker’s “dexterity at his own particular trade seems, in this manner, to be acquired at the expence of his intellectual, social, and martial virtues,” until, finally, the worker “is altogether incapable of judging” (WN, p. 782). Because this cognitive truncation can be so pervasive and profound, let us look more closely at its potential effects.

Smith had argued in his Theory of Moral Sentiments that our moral sensibilities are not present at birth; neither are they transcendent truths awaiting to be apprehended by reason. Instead, they are learned by our interactions with others (Otteson 2002; Hanley 2009; Forman-Barzilai 2011; Weinstein 2013). Smith believes, however, that all of us do have an innate desire for “mutual sympathy of sentiments” (TMS, pp. 13–16). When we see that others agree with us, or when we imagine that others would agree with us if they knew our full situations, we find this “sympathy of sentiments” pleasurable. When, by contrast, we perceive that others disagree with us, or we imagine they would disagree if they knew our situations, we feel discomfort.

Smith in one place indicates that by “account” he means “arithmetick” (WN, p. 777); in another, he suggests “the elementary parts of geometry and mechanics” (WN, p. 785). For discussion of Smith’s proposals for provision of education, see Otteson (2024).

Moral development might result from both grasping mind-independent moral truths and specifying their content relative to a community’s circumstances. See Robson (2020, pp. 524–33) and Robson (2021) on how experiments in living help communities to learn about justice and social morality generally.
