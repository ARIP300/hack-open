# Chatbot breakthrough in the 2020s? An ethical reflection on the trend of automated consultations…

receives (European Commission 2018, p. 20). Conversely, health consultation chatbots are partially automated proactive decision-making agents that guide the actions of healthcare personnel.

Our discussion proceeds in three sections. First, we introduce health chatbots and their historical background and clarify their technical capabilities to support the work of healthcare professionals. Second, we consider how the implementation of chatbots amplifies the project of rationality and automation in professional work as well as changes in decision-making based on epistemic probability. We then discuss ethical and social issues relating to health chatbots from the perspective of professional ethics by considering professional-patient relations and the changing position of these stakeholders on health and medical assessments. Finally, to ground our analysis, we employ the perspective of HCPs and list critical aspects and challenges relating to how chatbots may transform clinical capabilities and change patient-clinician relationships in clinical practices in the long run. We stress here that our intention is not to provide empirical evidence for or against chatbots in health care; it is to advance discussions of professional ethics in the context of novel technologies. The paper’s main contributions are theoretical and philosophical in nature.

# Health consultation chatbots

Following Pasquale (2020), we can divide the use of algorithmic systems, such as chatbots, into two strands. First, there are those that use ML ‘to derive new knowledge from large datasets, such as improving diagnostic accuracy from scans and other images’. Second, ‘there are user-facing applications […] which interact with people in real-time’, providing advice and ‘instructions based on probabilities which the tool can derive and improve over time’ (p. 55). The latter, that is, systems such as chatbots, seem to complement and sometimes even substitute HCP patient consultations (p. 55).

The most famous chatbots currently in use are Siri, Alexa, Google Assistant, Cordana and XiaoIce. Despite their popularity, they are not used in health care. Two of the most popular chatbots used in health care are the mental health assistant Woebot and Omaolo, which is used in Finland. From the emergence of the first chatbot, ELIZA, developed by Joseph Weizenbaum (1966), chatbots have been trying to ‘mimic human behaviour in a text-based conversation’ (Shum et al. 2018, p. 10; Abd-Alrazaq et al. 2020). Thus, their key feature is language and speech recognition, that is, natural language processing (NLP), which enables them to understand, to a certain extent, the language of the user (Gentner et al. 2020, p. 2).

As Lee et al. (2020, p. 339) have pointed out, chatbots ‘can be classified based on their purpose (i.e., assistant or conversation) and mode of communication (i.e., text or voice)’. Their purpose can be divided into two categories: task-oriented (or goal-oriented) and social (Galitsky 2019, p. 3). The task-oriented purpose usually has to do with being an ‘assistant’, while the social role is ‘conversational’ in nature. The former employs a question–answer style or step-by-step conversation. These chatbots depend on ‘supervised learning, reinforcement learning and an extensive domain-specific knowledge’ (p. 3). The latter, namely social chatbots, are not usually task-oriented, unless the ‘sociality’ itself is the task or goal. This might be the case especially in healthcare chatbots that strive to help with mental health.

In the healthcare field, in addition to the above-mentioned Woebot, there are numerous chatbots, such as Your.MD, HealthTap, Cancer Chatbot, VitaminBot, Babylon Health, Safedrugbot and Ada Health (Palanica et al. 2019). Most of them are simple, user-faced and task-oriented (similar to ELIZA). One example of a task-oriented chatbot is a medical chatbot called Omaolo developed by the Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare (THL), which is an online symptom assessment tool (e-questionnaire) (Atique et al. 2020, p. 2464; THL 2020). The chatbot is available in Finnish, Swedish and English, and it currently administers 17 separate symptom assessments. However, what makes Omaolo more than an automated questionnaire is ‘an electronic engine of medical knowledge, which operates according to evidence-based medical information […]’ and ‘combines the symptoms, measurement results and health information reported by the resident with research data and the official care guidelines’ (THL 2020, p. 10). Omaolo-related instructions underline that ‘answers are assessed mechanically with software built on the logical [and automatic] reasoning of’ the Finnish Medical Society Duodecim’s Evidence-Based Medicine Electronic Decision Support (EBMEDS) (THL 2020, p. 12; Duodecim 2020, p. 2).

Omaolo has a variety of purposes. First, it can perform an assessment of a health problem or symptoms and, second, more general assessments of health and well-being. Third, it can perform an ‘assessment of a sickness or its risks’ and guide ‘the resident to receive treatment in services promoting health and well-being within Omaolo and in social and health services external to’ it (THL 2020, p. 14). Fourth, it offers quality-of-life surveys, oral health surveys and health coaching. In the aftermath of COVID-19, Omaolo was updated to include ‘Coronavirus symptoms checker’, a service that ‘gives guidance regarding exposure to and symptoms of
