three categories: financial aid, job support, and tax reductions. The government allocated a total of US$35 billion for the special relief packages (Kuo, 2021). For financial aid, the public banks extended the loan repayment deadlines and deferred the credit card payments; the authorities adjusted the rent for national properties and supported small and medium enterprises by providing funds for business operations (KPMG, 2020b). In terms of job support, the government provided training programs and unemployment benefits (KPMG, 2020b). The government also allowed deferral of tax payments, conversion of lump sums to instalments, and waiver of corporate income tax payment for businesses affected by the pandemic (KPMG, 2020b).

In Malaysia, the Ministry of Health (MoH) played a crucial role in containing the spread of the virus. They conducted aggressive mass testing by tracing all the contacts of infected people and enforced health screening at all access points (Aziz et al., 2020; Shah et al., 2020). The findings by Gill et al. (2020) posit that the ability to trace high numbers of contacts in a timely manner could control the COVID-19 outbreak successfully. Likewise, both Singapore and Taiwan are doing the same by controlling the suspected patients’ movements to avoid another wave of infection. Drive-through screening tests that can be done within 5 min are available at various locations, and the MoH installed thermal scanners in all entry points to the country (Ch'ng, 2020; Tay et al., 2020). These measures are also implemented in Singapore and many other Asian countries.

Besides, the MoH has identified hospitals that would admit COVID-19 patients and hospitals that would act as screening and health centers. The hospitals also introduced telephone or internet consultation for non-urgent cases and only accepted urgent walk-in cases (Tay et al., 2020). Several scholars emphasized telemedicine’s importance and the potential for further development in Malaysia (Abdullah et al., 2020; Khor et al., 2020). To obtain quality surveillance data, the MoH used the eNotifikasi, a web-based infectious disease reporting system to model the spread of COVID-19 (Gill et al., 2020). The hospitals also introduced the Cloud Auto Detection Solution to enable early detection and diagnosis of infected patients (Chung, 2020). Taiwan has introduced a similar platform named TRACE since 2017 and utilized this platform for monitoring the development of COVID-19.

To reduce the financial impacts of the pandemic, the Malaysian government introduced several emergency economic aids such as the Prihatin Rakyat Economic Stimulus Package (PRIHATIN), the National Economic Recovery Package (PENJANA), and KITA PRIHATIN Package worth a total of RM315 billion; these supporting monetary schemes are designed to ease the people’s financial burden and help the enterprises who are struggling to retain their employees (The Star, 2020). The above economic packages include wage subsidy program 2.0 to support businesses faced with drops in revenue to ensure that their employees are getting reasonable wages and to reduce layoff or termination during the pandemic period. Consequently, those incentives sustained more than 300,000 enterprises, contained the unemployment rate, and saved 2.4 million jobs as of 24 June 2020 (Mohtar, 2020). Comparatively, Malaysia allocated the highest fiscal policy package to ease the people’s financial burden during pandemic period among the Asian countries, and ranked 2nd in the world, after Austria (Sarkodie & Owusu, 2021).

Unemployment and deaths are the most critical social consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic. In terms of unemployment rate, Malaysia recorded the highest compared with Singapore and Taiwan. As at April 2021, Malaysia recorded a 4.6% unemployment rate as compared with Singapore (2.9%) and Taiwan (3.71%) (Trading Economics, 2021). This is the result of the prolonged lockdown imposed by the Malaysian government, which had a significant impact on the national economy. Nevertheless, the unemployment rate for Malaysia decreased by 0.4%, that is, from 5% in April 2020 to 4.6% in April 2021 (Trading Economics, 2021). This is the positive outcome of implementing the above-mentioned economic stimulus packages by the Malaysian government in reviving the economic activities.

With reference to Fig. 1, Malaysia reported the highest death rate owing to the high number of confirmed COVID-19 cases compared with the figures of Taiwan and Singapore as at 30 April 2021. The total deaths in Malaysia, Taiwan and Singapore are 1506, 12, 30 respectively (Our World in Data, 2021). This indicates that the measures taken by Malaysia have not been very successful in reducing COVID-19 related deaths so far. One possible main reason is that many people staying in Malaysia are yet to be vaccinated. For instance, only 552,862 out of 32 million people had completed both doses of the vaccine as at 30 April 2021, which works out to only 1.73% of the population (The Star, 2021). The section below provides an analysis of the success-enabling and success-disabling factors of the Malaysian government in combating the COVID-19 pandemic thus far.

When the number of COVID-19 cases rising significantly since 14 March 2020, the Malaysian government implemented the MCO from 18 March to 3 May 2020 (Refer to Fig. 2). Thankfully, the MCO successfully broke the chain of COVID-19 infection in Malaysia on 29 April 2020 with the lowest national daily cases figure (two-digit number) reported since the enactment of the MCO, and the recovery rate was at 68.91% (Kaos, 2020; Kaos & Chung, 2020). In terms of
