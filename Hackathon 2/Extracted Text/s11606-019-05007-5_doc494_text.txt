# LEARNING OBJECTIVE #1:

Managing acute meningitis in the setting of spontaneous cerebrospinal fluid leak

# CASE:

A 53-year-old Hispanic mother of 5 children with no past medical history presented to our emergency department with headaches. Over the last 10 months she suffered labile headaches, cough and unilateral left sided rhinorrhea. Previously, these headaches were well controlled with acetaminophen and ibuprofen. However, 2 days prior to admission, she experienced subjective fevers, chills, nausea and vomiting. There was no history of foreign travel or head trauma. She went to see an Otolaryngology (ENT) doctor and was diagnosed with allergic rhinitis, treated with steroid nasal spray and recommended for allergy testing. Her headaches were exacerbated with standing and resolved completely when lying flat. She reported no phonophobia, photophobia or vision changes. She was febrile at 102.6F, otherwise vital signs were normal at admission. Laboratory results including a complete blood count, basic metabolic panel and urinalysis were within normal limits. Computerized Tomography (CT) of the head ordered in the emergency department showed intracranial hypertension and a lumbar puncture (LP) was deferred. Empiric antibiotics and antiviral coverage was initiated. Her MRI was negative for intracranial mass lesion and a LP was performed which was consistent with acute meningitis post initiation of antibiotic. A ENT consult was placed for nasal endoscopy which show no visible evidence of CSF leakage. Ultimately, due to the unrelenting nature of her headaches we elected to pursue further investigation of her unilateral nasal fluid leak. Our Neurologist recommended nasal rhinorrhea fluid collection and analysis for Beta2-transferrin which positively identified CSF. Additional imaging with high resolution CT including bone views identified a cribriform plate depression versus questionable fracture with soft tissue extension into the posterior fossa. A consultation with neurosurgery was made and she was transferred for higher level of care with continuation of Ceftriaxone for 2 weeks and neurosurgery to follow.

# IMPACT/DISCUSSION:

Spontaneous cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) rhinorrhea remains a relatively rare occurrence, incidence of 3-4% in all cases of CSF leaks (Beckhardt, 1991). Obese females in their 5-6 th decades of life are more likely to experience spontaneous CSF nasal leaks (Sayed MSU, Dunn CJ, Alaani A, 2012). Due to the potential complication of meningitis, spontaneous or traumatic CSF leaks requires a keen eye for detection and prompt treatment.

# CONCLUSION:

Originally postulated by Roman physician Galen during the first century A.D, CSF leak carries substantial risk for meningitis and death (Decherd, 1999). Identification of compromise to the blood brain barrier should be consider when investigating cases of meningitis. Unilateral rhinorrhea with reported changes in volume leak in relation to positional changes should be further investigated with high resolution CT imaging and appropriate consultation services.

# NOT 'JUST A PHLEBITIS': A CASE OF ENDOGENOUS METHICILLIN-RESISTANT STAPHYLOCOCCUS AUREUS ENDOPHTHALMITIS.

# LEARNING OBJECTIVE #1:

To identify the common presentations, risk factors, and treatments for bacterial endophthalmitis.

# CASE:

A 69 year-old female with uncontrolled diabetes mellitus and hypertension was referred from an affiliate eye clinic for further management of suspected endophthalmitis. One week before presentation, she was discharged from an outside hospital where she was admitted for suspected transient ischemic attack. Her family reported that she was febrile prior to discharge, and her peripheral IV site was erythematous and mildly purulent. The IV was removed and she left without medical therapy. Five days later, she developed weakness with worsening visual acuity and pain in the left eye, and after two days of symptoms she visited the eye clinic. She now presents with a fever of 101Â°F, left periorbital edema, marked left eye injection, and chemosis but no remaining phlebitis. Labwork was notable for a WBC count of 15 u/L with neutrophilia. Empiric IV vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam were started, and blood cultures later grew methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Urine culture and chest x-ray were unremarkable, and transesophageal echocardiogram showed no vegetations. Two vitrectomies and several intravitreal antibiotic injections lessened her swelling and pain but did not improve her sight. Her vitreous cultures remained sterile. She completed a 14-day course of IV antibiotics and was discharged with close ophthalmology follow-up.

# IMPACT/DISCUSSION:

We describe a case of endogenous MRSA endophthalmitis, suspected to be secondary to metastatic seeding from a peripheral IV-associated phlebitis. Endophthalmitis, a bacterial or fungal infection within the eye, is a sight-threatening emergency. Most cases are exogenous as a consequence of trauma, eye surgery, or as an extension of keratitis. Endogenous bacterial cases in the US are uncommon but may result from bacterial seeding of the eye by an endocarditis, urinary tract infections, abdominal abscesses, indwelling catheters, injection drug use, or procedures associated with transient bacteremia. Endogenous endophthalmitis is diagnosed when there are consistent ocular findings in the setting of bacteremia or by positive vitreous or aqueous cultures in patients without direct transmission. Although patients may present with signs of sepsis, less than 20% present with fever, and many patients present only with eye pain and decreased vision. Treatment includes systemic and intravitreal antibiotics, usually accompanied by vitrectomy. Clinical outcomes, including sight retention, are affected by the timeliness of appropriate antibiotic therapy and the virulence of the pathogen.

# CONCLUSION:

Acute endogenous bacterial endophthalmitis is a sight-threatening emergency. Given that such patients may have intermittent bacteremia, serial blood cultures and a careful assessment of nosocomial risk are essential adjuncts to optimal ophthalmologic management of those presenting with ocular symptoms in the absence of recent eye trauma or surgery.

# CASE:

A 41-year-old previously healthy female presented with 2 weeks duration of nausea, vomiting, generalized weakness. The patient lived on a farm and also reported a tick bite about 1 week prior to the development of her symptoms. Her physical examination was remarkable for dry mucous membranes and tenderness to palpation of RUQ of her abdomen. Laboratory tests revealed pancytopenia with white count of 2.20K/ul with ANC of 1K/ul, HgB 10.1g/dl, platelets of 48k/ul. Her BMP was significant for Na 128 mmol/l, Creatinine 1.7 mg/dl, CO2: 15 mmol/L. LFTs were elevated with AST 617 IU/L, ALT: 211 IU/L, LD: 1039 IU/L, GGT: 54 IU/L, ALP: 81 and Total Bilirubin 0.5. Lactate, procalcitonin, hepatitis, HIV tests were negative. Coagulation panel was within normal limits. Peripheral smear was negative for schistocytes. Blood cultures were obtained and she was started on intravenous fluids and broad spectrum antibiotics including doxycycline to cover for tick borne diseases. She
