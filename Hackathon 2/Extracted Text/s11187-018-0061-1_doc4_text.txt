# Entrepreneurship and attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder: a large-scale study involving the clinical... 385

# 3 Method

To examine whether the positive ADHD–entrepreneurship connection suggested by recent studies is in fact true when taking into account the clinical disorder, a large-scale study was undertaken. The purpose was to provide a basic straightforward examination of the connection between the condition of ADHD (independent variable) and entrepreneurial intentions (dependent variable 1) as well as entrepreneurial action/venturing (dependent variable 2). We were not interested in full-time entrepreneurs or employees—but rather focused on a population that is heterogeneous in terms of venturing activity (distinguishing between nascent actors and non-actors) as well as career intentions (distinguishing between individuals with and without intentions).

Accordingly, and following Verheul et al. (2015), we sampled about 9800 university students who participated in GUESSS Netherlands 2014. Comparing the Dutch sample with the global GUESSS sample, reported in Sieger et al. (2014), our sample was representative in terms of age, gender, management students, and the prevalence of self-employed parents.2

In relation to the research question, this sample is not intended to proxy some other population such as entrepreneurs, and offers a number of advantages. Given the nature of the sample and age of the respondents, the inquiry offers the advantage of capturing individuals prior to the possibility of being forced into entrepreneurship, and prior to selection and sampling biases that would be present in older workers. On a related note, it is important to acknowledge that individuals with ADHD are less likely to attend university (Barkley et al. 2008) and may be pushed into entrepreneurship via struggles with conventional employment (Parker, 2018, chapters 2 and 5). Thus, if significant results positively linking ADHD to entrepreneurship are found, they may understate what would be the effect in the general population. Hence, with the research question about whether in fact the condition of ADHD is linked to an increased entrepreneurial propensity (and not about providing a specific parameter estimate of a well-established effect generalizable to the overall population or providing insight into mechanisms underlying a link), the sample likely offers a conservative test of the fundamental relationship in question.

The data collection included the following variables: attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder—yes/no to whether the individual had the diagnosed condition of ADHD3; entrepreneurial intentions based on Linan and Chen (2009) and for robustness and replication also operationalized dichotomously with post-secondary career intention (Verheul et al. 2015); venturing/entrepreneurial action, operationalized as whether the individual was in the process of starting or already running a venture; and covariate/control variables (gender, age, self-employed parents, academic performance, management as field of study). The latter were included based on their consistency with prior entrepreneurship research (Verheul et al. 2015; Parker, 2018, chapters 2 and 5).

In terms of ADHD, 4.2% (n = 411) reported having the diagnosed condition. This is comparable to the adult ADHD community prevalence rate of 5% in the Netherlands (de Graaf et al. 2008) and more broadly to the 3.4% across 10 countries according to World Health Organization studies (de Graaf et al. 2008). That said, the following issues may arise when collecting the data. First, there is the possibility of under-reporting: Some individuals with ADHD may falsely report that they do not have the condition, for example because they fear stigmatization. Such false-negatives would reduce an already very minor base rate and add noise to the empirical testing—increasing the likelihood of null effects (and type-II error), and decreasing the likelihood of significant results. Second, in terms of possible over-reporting, there was no reason for undiagnosed individuals to falsely report an ADHD diagnosis in the data collection. Also, the rate of 4.2% does not suggest an over-reporting problem. Third, undiagnosed individuals.

ADHD is not seen or diagnosed as a temporary condition; it is associated with genetics and enduring neurological differences (physical brain-structure and neurotransmitters). Individuals previously diagnosed that may no longer meet diagnostic criteria, whether per taking medication or for other reasons, are often considered in-remission. In relation to the current research, attempting to separate ADHD-diagnosed individuals fully meeting diagnostic criteria at the time of data collection and those not meeting full diagnostic criteria at that moment was neither realistic (as it would require n = 411 individual clinical evaluations by psychiatrists or clinical psychologists), nor was it considered essential for our basic research question. Nonetheless, supplemental analyses are provided examining ADHD-type symptoms at the time of data collection.
