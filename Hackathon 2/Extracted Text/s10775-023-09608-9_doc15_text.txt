Variables. Distance did not predict environmental monitoring in the regression model and had low correlations to all MME scores. The findings suggest perceptions of time distance into the future does not considerably affect any employability resources. On the other hand, individuals who were more impacted by their psychological futures are more likely to have employability resources related to environmental monitoring. This is in line with the definition of environmental monitoring as choosing the correct timing to act toward oneâ€™s career goals. In addition, the literature employs career time perspective interventions effectively promotes career planning (Marko & Savickas, 1998) and thus employability resources (i.e., anticipation of future work changes, personal flexibility, corporate sense, and balance) linked to it (Lo Presti el al., 2019). The unexpected prediction of impact on social capital was weak and might be due to the characteristics of the sample.

Finally, the fourth hypothesis stated that life satisfaction would predict all factors, though with low magnitude. Despite the weak correlations to all MME scores, life satisfaction predicted only environmental monitoring in the regression models. This is the employability dimension mostly related to life conditions. Thus, life satisfaction might be related to better living conditions that, in turn, influence environmental monitoring.

The MME is a useful tool for research and practice with unemployed persons. In the research context, it might be used in investigations interested in employability and motivational resources. In the professional context, the MME might be applied in counseling practices to help identify employability resources. Based on its scores, interventions may be designed to directly support the development of employability resources, focusing on activities that may also stimulate motivational and emotional features.

# Limitations and future directions

This study has limitations. First, data collection was online and thus future studies may be implemented in more controlled environments (i.e., in person or synchronous online data collection). Second, a considerable number of participants had not finished high school, which might have impacted the comprehension of the test content (especially with regard to item 12, which, as already mentioned, may have been misinterpreted). Third, although 39 foreign participants were included, 35 of them were from countries in which mother language is Portuguese. The remaining participants assured their proficiency in Portuguese, so they were not excluded. Nevertheless, cultural issues may have had an impact on the results and thus future studies should take this variable into account. Fourth, the sample size is small, which may have influenced the results (Kline, 2011). Nevertheless, the results are congruent with previous studies supporting the four-factor hierarchical structures of the measure (Lo Presti et al., 2019). Moreover, the findings are relevant considering that participants belong to a population traditionally hard to reach in research contexts. Fifth, since the sample is limited to the population of Algarve, future studies may include unemployed persons living in other regions in Portugal.
