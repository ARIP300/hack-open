# 2.1 Lawmaking and Enforcement under Knowledge Uncertainties: From a Compliance Approach to a Proactive Application of Laws

Schumpeter was one of the first economists to recognize innovation as the real driving force of social change (see the following line of arguments at von Grafenstein 2020). He saw “the new consumers’ goods, the new methods of production or transportation, the new markets, the new forms of industrial organization that capitalist enterprise creates” as the most important impulse “that sets and keeps the capitalist engine in motion” (Schumpeter 2003, pp. 82–83). A legislator who intervenes in such an evolutionary market inevitably faces the knowledge uncertainties created by its innovations. The regulation of risks and, more recently, the regulation of innovation put this kind of knowledge uncertainty into the center of their approach. While the regulation of risks addresses the question of the appropriateness of protection measures against such risks (Jaeckel 2010), the approach of innovation regulation raises the additional question of how such protection measures should be designed so that they do not unnecessarily hinder innovation or even promote it (Hoffmann-Riem 2006). Interestingly, economists deal with the phenomenon of knowledge uncertainty in an almost mirror-inverted way: The Discovery and Creation Theory, two economic approaches, both deal in particular with the knowledge certainty and uncertainty of the innovative entrepreneur, i.e. the actor who brings an innovation onto the market (Schumpeter 2003, p. 132). Both theories address the question of how entrepreneurs use business opportunities in their entrepreneurial process: Do they discover business opportunities or do they create these opportunities themselves (Alvarez and Barney 2007)? In both cases – and this is the crucial point – the law can be understood as a factor of the entrepreneurial environment (Gartner 1985), which does not have to be an obstacle to innovation, but can promote innovation if properly designed (Mayer-Schonberger 2010).

Against this background, legal principles and undetermined legal terms are much better suited for designing a law that is open to innovation than specific “command and control” rules. The reason for this is that such legal instruments give an innovative entrepreneur, as the addressee of the regulation, much more leeway to find the best solution for implementing the law in his or her specific case. At the same time, however, this approach creates considerable legal uncertainty as neither the companies nor those affected, e.g. data subjects, can know with certainty whether or not the entrepreneur’s concrete implementation of the law meets the expectations of the regulator (Eifert et al. 2012). Applying these considerations to the GDPR, one recognizes immediately that this law is actually very open to innovations: it is literally peppered with legal principles and undetermined legal terms (see in particular the principles under Article 5 GDPR, for example, the purpose limitation principle, and under Article 25 GDPR, for example, the concept of risk). Here the GDPR leaves a considerable room for maneuver for the controller as well as the processors, which they can determine proactively under consideration of the characteristics of their specific case. However, this room for maneuver also leads, as already mentioned, to a considerable legal uncertainty.

# 2.2 Under Which Conditions Can the GDPR Offer Competitive Advantages? The Risk-Based Approach, Certificates and Codes of Conduct

In fact, no observer sees the legal uncertainty associated with the GDPR as a competitive advantage. In contrast, empirical studies demonstrate that legal uncertainty generally has negative effects on companies (Hartog et al. 2011; Levie and Autio 2011). Interestingly, even if legal certainty is high, small and medium-sized enterprises hardly profit if compliance with the law means too much expenditure for them. Due to their small size, compliance costs are quickly disproportionately high (Levie and Autio 2011). This raises the question of how a legislator can design innovation-friendly laws while keeping legal uncertainty and bureaucratic costs low. With regard to the GDPR, this is possible in three ways:

1. First, the so-called risk-based approach makes it possible to adapt the regulatory burden of the GDPR to the actual risk of the processing, which includes the amount of data to be processed (EDPB 2016). If thus the processing of personal data is not at the center of a company’s business model, its effort required to comply with the GDPR can be relatively low. This can be seen differently if the processing entails a high risk for the data subjects despite its small scope (e.g., a company processing sensitive data such as information on health or financial circumstances) or in a way that has a negative effect on data subjects. In such a case, however, the compliance effort is again proportionate due to the increased risk (Schröder 2019).
2. Second, the GDPR enables controllers and processors to proactively create legal certainty themselves. This is possible by specifying the undetermined provisions of the GDPR in two ways: either in relation to the processing of their specific products or services by means of a certificate, or together with other companies of a certain processing sector by means of a code of conduct (see Art. 40–43 GDPR). In each case, compliance with a certificate or code of conduct is considered to be an important factor in the verification of GDPR conformity (see, for example, Art. 24 (3), Art. 25 (3) and Art. 32 (3) as well as Art. 83 (3) (j) GDPR).
