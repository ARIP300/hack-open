like a criminal—29%, treated as dangerous—25%), and being held to a higher standard (38%). Three of the most common macro‑discriminations directly related to employment were an inability to find a job (16%), losing a job (15%), and failure to obtain a promotion (12%).

Despite research highlighting the deleterious effects of stigma at work, we know little about the impact of workplace stigma on SUD treatment and recovery outcomes. However, the 2018 National Survey on Drug Use and Health revealed that among individuals in need of SUD treatment, 37.8% did not seek treatment because of stigmatization‑related concerns—17.2% because others would have a negative opinion of them and 20.6% because it might harm or jeopardize their job (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, 2019). In addition, a small body of research on public exposure to stigmatizing attitudes and behaviors suggests it creates a critical barrier to recovery. By undermining recovery capital and increasing motivation to avoid pejorative labels and discrimination, stigmatization resulting from SUDs may (a) decrease initiation of unassisted and treatment‑assisted recovery efforts; (b) increase the likelihood of failed self‑change efforts, treatment attrition, and poor treatment outcomes; and (c) reduce the sustainability of recovery efforts (Buchanan & Young, 2000; da Silveira et al., 2018; Luoma et al., 2014; Marlatt & Witkiewitz, 2005; National Academies of Sciences‑Engineering‑Medicine, 2016a; Worley, 2017). These results suggest that SUD stigma in the workplace would undermine the likelihood that individuals approach their employers or union officials for help or take advantage of existing employer/union‑sponsored programs (e.g., employee assistance programs, member assistance programs, employee resource groups). However, we are not aware of any research directly addressing this issue.

# Research Proposition 4

Exposure to SUD stigmatization at work will decrease the likelihood of (a) initiating unassisted and treatment‑assisted recovery efforts, (b) achieving or sustaining abstinence, and (c) achieving broad recovery outcomes such as growth in positive recovery capital and improved physical, psychological, and social well‑being.

# Workplace Recovery Supports

# Positive work conditions

Positive work conditions represent events and experiences that are pleasant and may act as work‑related resources. These resources allow individuals to “conduct and complete their work, meet expected job demands, accomplish goals, value their work, and ultimately experience higher levels of engagement” (Lee et al., 2020, p. 27). Positive work conditions include fair treatment, recognition, meaningful work, skill variety, autonomy, acquisition and use of skills, fair rewards, promotion opportunities, friendship formation, and social support from coworkers and supervisors.

Although research is limited, positive work conditions may support SUD recovery in two ways. First, by removing the motivation to self‑medicate, they may reduce substance misuse, increase abstention, and reduce relapse (Albertsen et al., 2006; Frone, 2015). Therefore, positive work conditions may minimize the development or perpetuation of SUDs and promote recovery by reducing the likelihood of returning to substance use and increasing recovery’s sustainability by reducing relapse.
