# EVALUATION:

Pre-curricular surveys assessed student values and attitudes surrounding leadership, community engagement, altruism, and confidence in addressing SDoH of their patients. Results showed students highly value community involvement, physician leadership, and altruism, with mixed results in confidence and experience in addressing SDoH. Post-curricular surveys will be administered to students with results to be presented at the conference. Additionally, community partners will be surveyed about impact of service projects and student characteristics and interactions with community members.

# DISCUSSION / REFLECTION / LESSONS LEARNED:

A service learning curriculum proved to be a powerful tool to introduce students to experiential learning around community engagement and organizing, teamwork, leadership, and the influence of SDoH on individual and community health outcomes. Students reflected on the roles of physicians in communities and felt empowered by their partnerships with community members. Workshops with facilitated reflection focused on team dynamics and leadership led to powerful discussions among students and pushed students to expand their roles outside of comfort zones leading to personal and professional growth.

# DEVELOPMENT AND INITIAL EVALUATION OF COMMUNITY HEALTH CURRICULUM IN AN INTERNAL MEDICINE RESIDENCY PROGRAM: YEAR ONE

# NEEDS AND OBJECTIVES:

In the changing landscape of healthcare, physicians must be adaptive, visionary and evidence-based in their approach to care. Medical education must be adjusted to allow learners to gain skills that prepare them to function effectively in this new paradigm. In order to meet these needs, we developed a community based curriculum with emphasis on transitions of care, population health and innovation of care.

# SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS:

Curriculum was developed as part of a new NYU Internal Medicine Residency Community Health Track, housed at NYU Langone Hospital- Brooklyn, a community based, academic teaching hospital. Ambulatory training is based at the Family Health Centers at NYU Langone, a network of FQHCs. Both the hospital and FQHCs serve a vulnerable, diverse community in south Brooklyn. To date we have recruited one class of 10 interns. As of July 2020 we anticipate having a full track consisting of 30 residents.

# DESCRIPTION:

Our first year curriculum aims to develop a framework for thinking about community health introducing key concepts such as population-based care, novel delivery of care, and interdisciplinary collaboration. Early in their training, residents completed a community assessment using observational data, interviews and census track data. These assessments paired with collaboration with CHW and community organizations gave them first hand exposure to our area's specific challenges and gaps in care. The residents began to develop skills in home care by working with an interdisciplinary team of doctors, nurses and CHWs. Additionally, they participated in a transitions of care workshop, examining their own hospital patients who had been readmitted and identifying best practices for hospital discharge.

# EVALUATION:

A multi-method evaluation plan is essential as we evaluate and strengthen the curriculum. Qualitative feedback is gathered at regular intervals throughout the year along with surveys of trainees. Initial results suggest that curricula is well-received by residents. Aggregated longitudinal educational data including resident self-report, 360 evaluations and performance-based assessment, (OSCEs, USP visits) will contribute to program evaluation. The most important outcome will be how these trainees practice once they have graduated. We plan to use post-graduate surveys to judge the impact of the curriculum.

# DISCUSSION / REFLECTION / LESSONS LEARNED:

We adapted curriculum to focus on our particular community and created innovative programs to improve the population's health. Essential to these accomplishments was our partnership with learners and our reliance on their feedback to guide curriculum development. Allowing trainees to explore their interests has lead to visionary projects. We have learned that by being flexible and adapting to the learners' needs and interests we can serve our community in deeper ways than we had initially anticipated. However, structural limitations of the clinic coupled with institutional changes resulted in a slower time frame for clinical adaptations.
