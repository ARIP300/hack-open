# Barriers to Well-Being in an Urban Academic Center

The scope of my job...but most of the rest of the non-physician staff view their roles as having very clear boundaries, and "A provider should not be looking for staples, fixing printers and rooming patients." Other barriers to well-being were misaligned leadership values, lack of continuing education resources, missing supplies, heavy workload, and insufficient rewards or incentives.

CONCLUSIONS: Faculty in an urban academic center reported a number of barriers to well-being on a qualitative survey. The main factors were poor team cohesiveness and workflow, environmental dysfunction, and insufficient staffing. Limitations of the study include small sample size, qualitative analysis, and lack of generalizability to other clinics. However, the utility of this analysis is that it can be hypothesis generating for future quantitative work, and it can provide ideas for potential interventions to improve well-being for faculty in this clinic.

(Control ID #3179178)

BACKGROUND: Behavioral health integration in primary care is effective but challenging to disseminate and implement in healthcare systems. Over the past decade, the Primary Care-Mental Health Integration (PC-MHI) (i.e., care management, specialist collaborative care) and Patient Aligned Care Teams (PACT) (i.e., patient-centered medical home) initiatives transformed VA primary care clinics nationally into team-based care models to improve care for patients with psychiatric conditions. With increasing use of PC-MHI services over time, mental health care has accordingly shifted from specialty to PACT/primary care settings. We examined the combined effects of PC-MHI and PACT initiatives on quality of mental health care among VA primary care patients.

METHODS: We examined 828,050 primary care patients in 396 VA clinics mandated to offer PC-MHI services nationally (10/1/2013-9/30/2016). We calculated each clinic's PC-MHI penetration (i.e., the proportion of assigned primary care patients seen by a PC-MHI provider) and PACT implementation Progress Index (PI2) (i.e., measure of core PACT components [e.g., access, care coordination]) annually. Trained chart abstractors reviewed patient records for 11 process quality measures for psychiatric illness screening and management. In multilevel logistic regressions, we used clinic PC-MHI penetration to predict odds of meeting each quality measure, controlling for PI2, regional healthcare system, clinic characteristics (e.g., size, rurality), and patient characteristics (e.g., age, gender).

RESULTS: Clinic screening rates for depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and alcohol misuse were high (on average, 96%, 99%, and 97%). Average rates of clinician follow-up within 24 hours following abnormal screening were 64% (depression), 79% (PTSD), and 79% (alcohol misuse). In adjusted models, there were no PC-MHI or PI2 effects observed among all mental health care quality indicators. There were no observed differences in care quality due to differences in gender, racial-ethnicity, homelessness, physical comorbidity, and serious mental illness. There were slight improvements to care quality related to patient ageâ€”timely follow-up of abnormal depression (Odds ratio[OR] =1.01; p=.04) and PTSD (OR=1.01; p=.01) screening.

CONCLUSIONS: Although mental health treatment uptake has historically been poor in primary care, VA primary care patients continue to receive high quality mental health care (i.e., screening and timely follow-up). Without changing care quality, PC-MHI actively engaged more patients in care and reduced their reliance on specialty-based mental health resources. We observed no differences in VA clinical care quality for patients of racial-ethnic minorities, nor for vulnerable patients (i.e., homeless, serious mental illness). Results examining VA's national dissemination of PC-MHI and PACT models highlight remaining mental health quality gaps and encourage continued model optimization to improve mental health care processes in primary care.

# BEYOND THE BOOM: HEPATITIS C AND PEOPLE WHO INJECT DRUGS AT A SUBURBAN TERTIARY ACADEMIC MEDICAL CENTER 2016-2017

BACKGROUND: In 2004, adults aged 40-60, the 1945-1965 "Baby Boomer" birth cohort comprised 74% of NYS Hepatitis C (HCV) cases. By 2014, a bi-modal distribution emerged with Baby Boomers' share of HCV cases falling to 45.1%, and a new second peak of 20-40-year olds accounting for 38% of all HCV cases (2016 NYS DOH HIV Epidemiological Profile). In 2016 Stony Brook Hospital, a Tertiary Academic Hospital in Long Island NY, instituted a successful opt-out HCV screening and linkage to care initiative targeted to all persons born between 1945-1965. Long Island (comprising Nassau and Suffolk Counties) is an epicenter of the national opioid use and overdose epidemic. This study aims to look beyond Baby Boomers to quantify Hepatitis C screening rates for high risk and hard to reach suburban people who inject drugs (PWID) born after 1965.

METHODS: This study is a retrospective chart review 1/1/2016-11/30/2017 at Stony Brook University Hospital to identify Opioid Related Visits (ORV) and patients with a history of injection drug use. Charts were selected based on discharge ICD-10 codes related to opioid use. ER visits and hospital admissions were classified as ORV if associated with non-prescribed opioid use and 1) infection, 2) overdose, and/or 3) altered mental status. Individual charts were electronically queried using chart search function for the following keywords: Heroin, Cocaine, IVDA, IVDU or IV Drug to identify people with a hospital visit related to non-prescribed opioid use and/or history of injection drug use.

RESULTS: This study identified 1,030 Opioid Related Hospital Visits made by 684 unique people born after 1965 with a history of injection drug use. Only 24% of these individuals had any hepatitis C testing. 57% of these visits were for opioid overdose. For individuals who presented with an opioid overdose and documented history of injection drug use, only 19% had a hepatitis C test on record within the study period. Among this group, testing was more frequently associated with age and female gender, with only 15% of men aged 18-29 having any hepatitis C testing compared to 32% of women aged 30-44 and 45-51.

CONCLUSIONS: In July 2018, NYS Governor Cuomo announced a declaration to "end hepatitis C in New York State." The CDC recommends testing anyone who has injected drugs for HCV. The relatively low HCV screening rates for young people with a recent Opioid Related Visit and history of injection drug use suggests the need to expand HCV screening programs to target PWID as a necessary first step towards eradicating HCV virus in Long Island. Stigma around injection drug use, along with suburban geography pose unique challenges for outreach, screening, harm reduction, and treatment. Healthcare facilities must move beyond Baby Boomers and target screening and harm reduction efforts towards people who inject drugs to eradicate Hepatitis C.
