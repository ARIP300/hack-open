of healthcare is a drastic example of how the free market is unable to provide public services. One way to do this is by strengthening community engagement. In the 1960s and 1970s, the social psychiatry movement saw similar issues with environmental causes of mental illness (Smith, 2016). Proponents of social psychiatry believed that the best way to address this issue was through the creation of community mental health centers to frame mental health as a community issue and for psychiatrists and other providers to take a more civically active role (Smith, 2016). However, there were several issues with community health centers, which included funding cuts by the Reagan administration, lack of coordination between inpatient and outpatient care, and cultural and racial tensions between the mental health professionals and the patients they served (Smith, 2016).

A resurgence of the movement for community mental health centers could help address issues of social isolation, provide patients with resources for education and social mobility, and provide opportunities for civic engagement. Past failures to implement community mental health centers should be closely studied to avoid repeating earlier mistakes (Smith, 2016). Another possible intervention is Integrative Community Treatment (ICT), which is a psychosocial intervention originating in Brazil used to address social isolation during the COVID-19 pandemic (Barreto et al., 2020). ICT facilitates groups among community members that involve strengthening social bonds and building community support networks (Barreto et al., 2020). This strategy could be used in the United States where deaths from suicide, opioid overdose and alcoholic liver cirrhosis are high. Providers could also work with patients individually on ways to cope with the stress of loneliness, materialism, and status competition.

However, these interventions would not address the policy changes needed for a more comprehensive solution. Although supportive individual treatment through medication and psychotherapy are helpful to many, the cultural and economic issues due to neoliberal capitalism also need to be addressed due to the scale of the problem we are facing and the limited number of mental health providers available. One possible avenue is for mental health providers to support national policies that facilitate more equal income distribution and universal health insurance through our professional organizations. It is also important that mental health providers support policies that address the power dynamics between employers and employees, such as advocating for limitations on lobbying, unionization, cooperative business models, and regulation preventing industry monopolies (Case & Deaton, 2020).

Providers can also get involved with advocacy at the state level by testifying at state legislative hearings to support efforts such as state proposals to increase minimum wage and increase state spending on public services to decrease mental health burdens. These socio-political causes of mental distress have affected so many and can
