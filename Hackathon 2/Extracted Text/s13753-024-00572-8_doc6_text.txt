# Adekola and Chia. Stakeholder Theory, Public Engagement, and Epistemic Injustice

people didn’t really feel free to ask questions, even on trust. This also feeds into the epistemic problems regarding conflicting claims and contradictory behaviors. In this sense, no one seems confident and yet, some voices are delegitimized. People have a choice and people should be able to express that choice … why was it not okay for people to ask questions and make an informed decision? And the reason was nobody really knew what was going on … All of a sudden, it actually felt like … people were like statistics rather than people, owned by something, that you just have to comply with. You were not free to ask questions. (Edinburgh community participant 13)

# 5.3 Unfair Denial of Stakeholders’ Rights

A third condition of epistemic injustice occurs when a knowing individual is affected by policy decisions made but are excluded from influencing them; they experience an unjust denial of stakeholder rights. It is worth noting that discussions around vaccine access, misinformation/conspiracies, and hesitancy have taken place during the Covid-19 pandemic. In the ACB communities, concerns about historical medical injustices, access to vaccines, and the need for culturally sensitive approaches that take the perceptions and circumstances of minority communities have been raised. According to a community leader in the Edinburgh community discussion:

There was this whole net of people underground who didn’t have access to GPs [general physicians], who couldn’t get the vaccine anyway. And if we’re talking in terms of Covid being a public health risk, I feel like the government failed where that’s concerned ... Up to now, we still have people that are in dire circumstances, homeless, living in hostels, not having access to [vaccines] ... And it’s really about giving the treatment and giving everybody access to the treatment, giving everybody access to vaccines, and within that, respect that was a huge problem, especially within the niche [Black refugee groups] that I work in. (Edinburgh community leader 2)

Injustice against epistemic capacity here involves the denial of recognition and consideration for the valuable insights and efforts of the small organization run by those from the ACB communities. It reflects a systemic issue where those with significant on-the-ground knowledge are sidelined in favor of more visible or established organizations, perpetuating a cycle of inequality and limiting the potential for collaborative and comprehensive solutions from the grassroots level. Moreover, government officials were breaking pandemic-related rules, negatively impacting public trust in these authorities. The information on Matt Hancock, Dominic Cummings, and Boris Johnson violating the government’s Covid-19 advice is widely known. It has been circulated in the public domain, creating a notable discussion and raising questions about adherence to pandemic guidelines by prominent figures. This breach of public trust has led to accusations of inconsistency and hypocrisy in enforcing public health measures.

Moreover, forced vaccination through employment, colloquially termed “no jab, no job,” was identified as a coercive tactic, further diminishing public trust. A community leader at the Glasgow community discussion highlighted:

There was a whole lot of conspiracy theories out there. People didn’t understand what the vaccines were. Then I remembered from the Nigerian Community Scotland, we had an awareness program online and we had to bring people in to let people know what vaccines are … I remember having to contact my own GP and others, and they didn’t even have people who could do things online, like come to the community and talk to the community about this.
