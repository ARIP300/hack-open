both the data subjects and the companies do not know exactly what information is contained in the data and for what purpose it can be used. Another example for this is the right of information, in which companies and authorities use a proliferation of requirements for authentication, processes, contact points and data formats that consumers have to deal with. These range from digital formats of spreadsheet programs to PDFs and paper printouts. The list could be continued.

Accordingly, design-oriented business and consumer informatics should take up the ball and develop standardized formats for consumer data as well as reference models for the usable information process. On the other hand, it should conduct research with industry and consumer protection organizations on innovative solutions for access and processing control that take the interests of the various parties, including consumers, into account in an appropriate manner in the interests of multilateral security.
