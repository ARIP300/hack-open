to mental healthcare due to the for profit healthcare system eliminated social programs (Moncrieff, 2001). Trade liberalization and deregulation of foreign financial investment led to increased volume of trade which demanded high rates of consumption and also provided sources of cheap labor abroad putting downward pressure on wages in the US (Moncrieff, 2001). Although Neoliberal policies were billed as attempts to enhance individual freedoms, forms of surveillance and policing became a key strategy to deal with social problems when social services were minimized (Harvey, 2005). This worked to maintain social order as well as uphold private property and corporate interests (Harvey, 2005). Neoliberalization has not been successful at increasing capital accumulation with the exception of the economic elite (Harvey, 2005). These policies have also led to staggering income inequality, disempowerment of workers in their ability to advocate for themselves, outsourcing of manufacturing jobs overseas, inadequate social services, mass incarceration and a healthcare system that is not only expensive but ineffective in providing for its citizens (Case & Deaton, 2020; Nkansah-Amankra et al., 2013).

# Neoliberalism

For the purposes of this discussion, neoliberalism refers to the economic theory that human well-being can be enhanced by individual entrepreneurship and that the government’s responsibility is to create an institutional framework that allows for it (Harvey, 2005). Markets are seen as optimal structures and the assumption is that if they were allowed to function without restraint, they would be able to serve all economic needs and generate full employment for all those who wish to work (Harvey, 2005). From this point of view, it is essential to eliminate restrictions on markets by decreasing the strength of unions, privatizing state enterprises, and opening domestic markets to foreign capital and goods (Shaikh, 2014). These policies deviated from the Keynesian economic policy in place after the Second World War that focused on full employment and the welfare of its citizens and used the State’s power to intervene in market processes to achieve this (Harvey, 2005).

Corporate activities were highly regulated and working class institutions were influential within the state apparatus (Harvey, 2005). By the end of the 1960s the economy was in turmoil while unemployment and inflation soared (Harvey, 2005). Neoliberalism became popular in order to solve this economic crisis (Harvey, 2005). In his book, A Brief History of Neoliberalism, David Harvey argues that the upper class supported these policies in order to further their own power and influence because they felt threatened by the decrease in their share in the national income (Harvey, 2005). Neoliberal policies were broadly enacted through the Reagan administration with corporate tax breaks and incentives, deregulation of business, and the introduction of working practices that strongly favor employers over unions (Harvey, 2005).

This was accompanied by transferring resources from public to private ownership and contracting out services that were once provided by the public sector (Moncrieff, 2001). The state also drastically reduced public sector spending and that the market rewards merit so the rich are seen as...
