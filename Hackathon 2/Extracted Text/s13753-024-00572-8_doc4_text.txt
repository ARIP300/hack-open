# Adekola and Chia. Stakeholder Theory, Public Engagement, and Epistemic Injustice

Stakeholder rights, unfair denial of knowledge, and unfair existing vulnerability. The first condition asserts that “for someone to be unjustifiably discriminated against as a knower, they must suffer epistemic and/or socioeconomic disadvantages and inequalities as a result from the discrimination” (Byskov 2021, p. 118). The second condition states that “for someone to be unjustifiably discriminated against as a knower, the discrimination must involve prejudiced (i.e., unfair) sentiments about the speaker” (Byskov 2021, p. 118). The additional conditions pertain to stakeholders’ rights, contributions to knowledge, and social justice. The third condition stipulates that “for someone to be unjustifiably discriminated against as a knower, they must be somehow affected by the decisions that they are excluded from influencing” (Byskov 2021, p. 118). The fourth condition states that “for someone to be unjustifiably discriminated against as a knower, they must possess knowledge that is relevant for the decision that they are excluded from” (Byskov 2021, p. 118). The fifth and last condition states that “for someone to be unjustifiably discriminated against as a knower, they must at the same time also suffer from other social injustices” (Byskov 2021, p. 118).

# 4 Methodology

The data for this study were collected between April and July 2022 following ethical approval from the University's ethics committee. Semistructured interviews were used to gather data, facilitating thorough discussions between the interviewer and participants. The sample comprised of six academics (professors), one public health practitioner, two religious leaders, and one senior government official in public health. Recruitment involved snowballing and purposive sampling methods (Tongco 2007; Valerio et al. 2016). Ethical concerns took precedence during the research, with all participants giving informed consent and their privacy and anonymity rigorously safeguarded (Grinyer 2009; Novak 2014). Three community discussions with members of Scotland’s African, Caribbean, and Black communities involved 25 participants each. Community discussions were conducted in Glasgow, Edinburgh, and Aberdeen. Participants from various backgrounds and ages were invited to discuss their views on Covid-19 vaccines. The aim was to provide a platform for participants to express their opinions, concerns, and suggestions regarding vaccine uptake. Community researchers facilitated community discussions to ensure a structured yet open conversation.

The interviews and community discussions were video recorded. Video analysis has emerged as a potent and innovative tool for qualitative research (Knoblauch et al. 2012). This methodology engaged participants in a reflective exploration of thematic elements within the film. Videography possesses a distinct capacity to captivate audiences in a manner unparalleled by conventional research methods. Belk and Kozinets (2005) underscored the videos’ ability to immerse viewers in a multi-sensory experience, facilitating cognitive understanding and generating enthusiasm and emotional connection among audiences. This emotional connection is cultivated by creating accessible, intimate experiences that enable individuals to authentically engage with the material (Kozinets and Belk 2006; Petr et al. 2015). The data collection process, via community discussions, provided a robust understanding of the barriers and facilitators of Covid-19 vaccine engagement.

The data collection continued until no new significant themes or insights emerged from the discussions and interviews, ensuring data comprehensiveness (Fusch and Ness 2015). This methodological approach allowed for a nuanced exploration of individual and community perspectives, contributing to a comprehensive analysis of the study’s objectives. The collected data were subjected to rigorous...
