condition (APA 2013; Goldman et al. 1998) and the vast majority of its effects. Consistent with traditional clinical psychology and psychiatry, in the clinical literature, ADHD is considered inherently pathological.

# 2.2 ADHD in organizational scholarship

In terms of the emerging management and entrepreneurship literature involving ADHD, recent studies have relaxed the need to empirically consider the actual condition of ADHD (i.e., individuals with the disorder) and instead have taken a disposition-type approach (with two exceptions subsequently elaborated). There are good and pragmatic reasons for this. The non-clinical consideration of a clinical construct has allowed empirically tractable investigations and uncovered significant, non-obvious findings, such as the positive association between ADHD-type behavior and entrepreneurship.

There are two noteworthy exceptions. First, the recent study of Wiklund, Patzelt, and Dimov (2016) illustrates and provides insight into how 14 Swedish entrepreneurs with ADHD behave. Their findings demonstrate the entrepreneurial relevance of having ADHD. In line with its qualitative design and contribution, the study cannot speak to—but further motivates—the need to understand whether there is a significant positive connection between ADHD and entrepreneurship, starting with whether ADHD significantly increases the likelihood of venturing. The second (partial) exception comes from Verheul et al. (2016) linking individuals’ continuous scores on an ADHD screener (the ASRS v1.1) to their self-employment status in two datasets. Specifically, Verheul et al. (2016) performed a sensitivity analysis where individuals were screened positive or negative for ADHD based on their ASRS score. Linking the dichotomous screening variable to self-employment, the authors found the positive association between ADHD (type behavior) and self-employment held.

For organizational research involving ADHD to advance, however, there is an issue. While empirically not studying the condition of ADHD, extant entrepreneurship research imported ADHD from the clinical literature, including a short screening tool for identifying individuals for possible clinical referral/evaluation. We appreciate that this can be entirely appropriate, depending on the research question, the state of (incipient) knowledge, and the research constraints. The present concern and hitherto limitation is the absence of a large-scale basis to consider whether the reported connection with entrepreneurship is true if considering attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Thus, the unresolved issue with the extant theory and research, suggesting a positive ADHD—entrepreneurship link, is that it has been built on and is fundamentally grounded in, the clinical literature involving a clinical construct and using a screening tool for the condition of ADHD, without yet comparing individuals with the condition and those without.

Toward building a sound literature, we need to understand if the recently suggested positive connection between ADHD and entrepreneurship is veridical when considering the condition of ADHD, i.e., operationalizing it consistent with its definition as a diagnosed condition/disorder. Based on the empirical and theoretical origins of ADHD, finding a positive link between the diagnosed condition and entrepreneurship would substantially bolster the emerging conversation. Specifically, this would validate recent entrepreneurship theory and findings which, despite involving clinical literature, have not tested or found a significant link between attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder and entrepreneurship. Thus, extending recent research that has examined a behavioral disposition that at one end of the spectrum might be indicative of ADHD (Lerner 2016; Thurik et al. 2016; Verheul et al. 2015, 2016; Wiklund et al. 2017), true to the grounding literature and ADHD construct, we focus on the clinical condition of ADHD.

# 2.3 ADHD and entrepreneurial intentions

Entrepreneurial intentions, typically defined as the extent to which an individual espouses intentions to form a venture/become an entrepreneur, has long been a topic of interest to entrepreneurship scholars (Krueger et al. 2000; Krueger and Brazeal 1994; Kolvereid 1996; Douglas and Shepherd 2002). Notwithstanding our ultimate interest in entrepreneurial action (versus intention), an important starting point for the scholarly consideration of a connection between ADHD and entrepreneurship is provided by Verheul et al. (2015). As the first large-scale scientific inquiry focusing on the topic, sampling of over 13,000 university students, Verheul...
