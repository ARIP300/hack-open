may affect SUD recovery is by increasing positive emotions and developing resources essential to recovery and well‑being. Affective events theory (Weiss & Cropanzano, 1996) proposes that positive work events and experiences lead to positive emotions. Further, the broaden‑and‑build theory (Fredrickson, 2004) asserts that positive emotions broaden an individual’s thought‑action repertoire involving awareness, creativity, thought processes, and action tendencies. This broadening of cognition and action allows individuals to build skills and resources that represent enduring reserves used in the future to build resilience and optimal functioning and increase physical, mental, and social well‑being. Consistent with affective events and broaden‑and‑build theories, research supports associations of positive work conditions to higher positive affect, physical health, mental health, job satisfaction, and work engagement (Balducci et al., 2011; Chiaburu & Harrison, 2008; Frone & Blais, 2020; Vantilborgh et al., 2016; Viswesvaran et al., 1999).

# Research Proposition 5

Positive work conditions will increase the likelihood of (a) initiating unassisted and treatment‑assisted recovery efforts, (b) achieving or sustaining abstinence, and (c) achieving broad recovery outcomes such as growth in positive recovery capital and improved physical, psychological, and social well‑being.

# Workplace social control

Social control theory posits that strong bonds with conventional social institutions (e.g., work organization) motivate individuals to engage in responsible behavior and refrain from substance misuse. In contrast, weak social bonds lead to substance misuse and other non‑normative behavior. Strong social bonds result from monitoring and shaping normative behaviors by groups and institutions (Moos, 2007a, b). Likewise, Roman (1980, p. 407) stated that workplace social control is “exercised through socialization, patterns of reward distribution, and efforts to identify and control deviant behavior.” Therefore, the workplace social control framework posits that substance misuse is reduced when employees are regulated by and integrated into the work organization (Ames & Moore, 2016; Frone, 2013, 2019).

Two general types of workplace social control exist: formal and informal (Frone, 2013, 2019). Formal social control represents workplace policies and their enforcement regarding the use of substances and impairment during the workday and handling prescription drugs in some occupations. Prior research provides inconsistent evidence that a workplace policy on substance use will have a deterrent effect by itself (Ames & Moore, 2016; Frone, 2013; Pidd et al., 2016). However, a formal workplace substance use policy combined with enforcement may have a deterrent effect (Ames & Moore, 2016; Frone, 2013, 2019). A national study of U.S. workers found that when employees believed their supervisor could identify and was willing to address workplace substance use problems, they reported lower levels of alcohol and illicit drug use before and during the workday, as well as lower levels of illicit drug use off the job (Frone & Trinidad, 2012). Finally, a study found that required witnessing of the disposal of prescription drugs and written documentation of their administration were both negatively associated with prescription drug misuse among registered nurses (Trinkoff et al., 1999).

Informal social control represents the structural and contextual features of work that increase job performance visibility, thereby increasing the likelihood of detection by others if one
