# Αdekola and Chia. Stakeholder Theory, Public Engagement, and Epistemic Injustice

Cultural competence training, actively engage with community leaders, and ensure diverse representation in healthcare settings. Community groups are encouraged to advocate for representation, empower members with health information, and collaborate with healthcare providers for community-specific solutions. Health researchers should embrace community-based participatory research, ensure diversity in study representation, and adhere to ethical research practices. Science and policy officials are urged to ensure inclusive decision making and transparent communication, and provide information in multiple languages to address the concerns and needs of marginalized communities. These recommendations collectively aim to promote an epistemic just society and a more equitable and culturally sensitive healthcare system.

# 7 Conclusion

The research explored the vaccine hesitancy case and illustrated how the failure to grasp power dynamics undermines the stakeholder approach. The analysis underscored the underrepresentation of diverse perspectives in decision making, hindering inclusive policies. A more comprehensive understanding and effective implementation of the stakeholder approach to public sector policy making must consider the unequal distribution of power and the possibility of epistemic injustice arising from such power dynamics. Epistemic justice demands transparency in decision-making processes. Communities should be able to hold policymakers and institutions accountable for their actions and the impact of their decisions. Lack of transparency can exacerbate epistemic injustices. Recognizing and valuing community knowledge is crucial for equitable pandemic responses.
