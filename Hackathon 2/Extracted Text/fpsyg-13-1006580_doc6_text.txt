mediates the relationship between work stress and employee performance. Therefore, hypothesis 3 is supported. To verify the moderating eﬀect of servant leadership on the relationship between work stress and mental health, we gradually added independent variables, a moderator variable, and interaction between the independent variables and moderator variable to the analysis, the results of which are presented in Table 5. In model 9, the moderating eﬀect of servant leadership is not supported (β = 0.030, p > 0.05). Therefore, hypothesis 4 is not supported.

# Discussion

empirical results are not signiﬁcant possibly because work stress of employees in SMEs is rooted in worries regarding the future of the macroeconomic environment, and the resulting mental health problems cannot be cured merely by a leader.

Hence, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, employees experience work stress, which precipitates mental health problems and poor employee performance. To solve the problem of work stress, SMEs should pay more attention to fostering servant leadership. Meanwhile, organizational culture is also important in alleviating employees’ mental health problems and thus reducing negative eﬀects of work stress on employee performance.

For SMEs, employees are core assets and crucial to their survival and growth (Shan et al., 2022). Speciﬁcally, owing to the COVID-19 pandemic, employees’ work stress may precipitate burnout (Choi et al., 2019; Barello et al., 2020), which inﬂuences their performance. Researchers and practitioners have signiﬁcantly focused on resolving the challenge of work stress (Karatepe et al., 2020; Tan et al., 2020; Gao, 2021). However, previous research has not clearly elucidated the relationship among work stress, mental health, servant leadership, and employee performance. Through this study, we found the following results:

Employees in SMEs face work stress owing to the COVID-19 pandemic, which reduces their performance. Facing these external shocks, survival and growth of SMEs may become increasingly uncertain (Adam and Alariﬁ, 2021). Employees’ career prospects are negatively impacted. Meanwhile, the pandemic has precipitated a change in the way employees work, their workspace, and work timings. Moreover, their work is now intertwined with family life. Hence, employees experience greater stress at work than ever before (Gao, 2021), which, in turn, aﬀects their productivity and deteriorates their performance.

Furthermore, we found that mental health plays a mediating role in the relationship between work stress and employee performance; this suggests that employees’ mental status is inﬂuenced by work stress, which, in turn, lowers job performance. Per our ﬁndings, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, employees experience nervous and anxious psychological states (Tan et al., 2020), which renders them unable to devote their full attention to their work; hence, their work performance is likely to decrease.

Finally, we found that leaders are the core of any enterprise (Ahn et al., 2018). Hence, their leadership behavior signiﬁcantly inﬂuences employees. Per previous research, servant leadership is considered a typical leadership behavior characterized by exhibiting humility, delegating power to employees, raising the morale of subordinates, and placing the interests of employees above their own (Sendjaya, 2015; Eva et al., 2019). Through theoretical analysis, we found that servant leadership mitigates the negative eﬀect of work stress on mental health. However, the

This study findings have several theoretical and managerial implications.

# Theoretical implications

First, per previous research, no consistent conclusion exists regarding the relationship between work stress and employee performance, including positive relationships (Ismail et al., 2015; Soomro et al., 2019), negative relationships (Yunus et al., 2018; Nawaz Kalyar et al., 2019; Purnomo et al., 2021), inverted U-shaped relationships (McClenahan et al., 2007; Hamidi and Eivazi, 2010), and no relationship (T˘an˘asescu and Ramona-Diana, 2019). We report that work stress negatively aﬀects employee performance in SMEs during the COVID-19 pandemic; thus, this study contributes to the understanding of the situational nature of work stress and provides enriching insights pertaining to positive psychology.

Second, we established the research path that work stress aﬀects employee performance. Mental health is a psychological state that may inﬂuence an individual’s work eﬃciency. In this study, we explored its mediating role, which opens the black box of the relationship between work stress and employee performance; thus, this study contributes to a greater understanding of the role of work stress during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Finally, this study sheds light on the moderating eﬀect of servant leadership, which is useful for understanding why some SMEs exhibit greater diﬃculty in achieving success than others during the COVID-19 pandemic. Previous research has explained the negative eﬀect of work stress (Yunus et al., 2018; Nawaz Kalyar et al., 2019; Purnomo et al., 2021). However, few studies have focused on how to resolve the problem. We identify servant leadership as the moderating factor providing theoretical support for solving the problem of work stress. This study expands the explanatory scope of the upper echelons theory.
