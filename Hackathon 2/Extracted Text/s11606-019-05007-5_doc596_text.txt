# ABSTRACTS

# EVALUATE PROGRAM/INTERVENTION

Residents complete an anonymous battery of questionnaires at the end of the academic year to evaluate their ambulatory training. The battery includes the IP Socialization and Valuing Scale (ISVS), the Primary Care Attitudes Scale (PCAS), and other questions assessing IP interactions, perceptions of the training site and workflows, and interest in primary care.

# FINDINGS TO DATE

During the 2017-18 assessment period, we observed a significant improvement in the frequency of interactions between residents and pharmacists (p=.006), MOAs (p=.03), our health psychologist (p=.004), and our care management staff (p=.004). Residents were also more likely to participate in team meetings or huddles (p<.001). However, we observed no increase in positive attitudes towards primary care careers. Content analysis of open-ended responses suggested that inefficient workflows and an excess of administrative tasks were key reasons for dissatisfaction with the ambulatory experience despite IP transformation.

# KEY LESSONS FOR DISSEMINATION

We hoped that more regular support from IP team members would lead to a better clinic experience and increased primary care interest. While we found that residents did in fact better appreciate working within an IP team, that alone was not sufficient to improve their overall clinic experience as the volume of administrative tasks was not eased or redistributed. Our next steps will target this feedback and aim to provide additional resident support through task triage strategies, sharing of tasks with MOAs and nurses, and protected task completion time.

(Control ID #3184420)

# STATEMENT OF PROBLEM OR QUESTION

Many patients who attend an urban, academic affiliated clinic reside in food deserts, lacking in access to fresh fruits and vegetables.

# OBJECTIVES OF PROGRAM/INTERVENTION

1. To establish a community garden next to the clinic to supply patients with fresh fruits and vegetables.
2. To involve patients, medical residents, medical students, physicians, nurses and other clinic members in the operations of the garden.
3. To distribute the produce to clinic patients and to educate them on the value of eating fresh fruits and vegetables.

# DESCRIPTION OF PROGRAM/INTERVENTION

An abandoned lot next to the medical clinic located in downtown Winston-Salem was transformed into a community garden which is comprised of 30 raised beds. After consultation with master gardeners and the local agricultural extension agency, volunteers were taught "hands on" techniques of organic gardening. Nearby grade schools and nurseries provided the garden with plants and seeds. Charitable donations were processed by a church partner and a community development organization provided funds to buy tools and supplies. The medical center donated an irrigation system and the fence surrounding the garden. In 2016 the garden received an award for its community outreach and the award funds were used to purchase a storage building. Volunteers included medical students and residents, clinic physicians, nurses and other personnel, local volunteer groups, garden clubs, scout troops, student service groups, a local temple and church, patients and residents of the neighborhood. Volunteers met at the garden 2-3 hours Saturday mornings March - Nov. to plant, weed, fertilize and harvest. Produce was weighed at each session and distributed to the clinic patients the following week.

# MEASURES OF SUCCESS

The success of the garden was measured by the following metrics:

1. Total produce distributed to patients.
2. Numbers of volunteers.
3. Numbers of patient/provider interactions in the distribution of produce in the clinic.

# FINDINGS TO DATE

1. The garden yields of the past three years are as follows: 2016 - 1400 pounds, 2017 - 1500 pounds, 2018 - 1485 pounds. Produce includes tomatoes, green beans, squash, okra, kale, lettuce, carrots, beets, cabbage, watermelon, blueberries, strawberries, onions, cucumbers, potatoes, collards, pumpkins, peas, chard, peppers and eggplant.
2. Each growing season had more than 100 volunteers; most volunteered on multiple occasions.
3. Assuming that patients received an average of 2 8 oz bags of produce, there were approximately 3000 opportunities to interact with patients while handing out produce in the clinic each growing season.

# KEY LESSONS FOR DISSEMINATION

A community garden in association with a medical clinic serves as a way to supply much needed fruits and vegetables to an underserved patient population. In addition, volunteers benefit from working together, enjoying "green" physical activity and addressing the common goals of taking care of plants and bringing the produce to their patients. In an informal manner, there was exchange of growing techniques, recipes and passing nutritional information on to patients.

# STATEMENT OF PROBLEM OR QUESTION

New protocols for managing patients with chronic pain on chronic opioid therapy propose tapering off opioids, however clinical experience has shown this to be difficult.

# OBJECTIVES OF PROGRAM/INTERVENTION

1. To assess patients on long-term opioids for chronic pain for opioid use disorder (OUD).
2. To assess a program of individualized assessment for OUD and individualized treatment plans coupled with group support.
3. To assist patients to taper opioids or transition to buprenorphine.

# DESCRIPTION OF PROGRAM/INTERVENTION

We expanded a program of monthly group visits for chronic pain patients on chronic opioid therapy to include individualized assessments for opioid use disorder and treatment plans based on these assessments. 23 patients.
