environments that promote positive work conditions and minimize negative work conditions. As discussed earlier, such work environments may increase the likelihood that those with current SUDs will initiate unassisted or treatment‑assisted recovery efforts and reduce the likelihood that those in recovery will return to substance use. Moreover, relative to low POS organizations, high POS organizations are more likely to build the human, physical, and social capital critical to the initiation and sustainability of SUD recovery and individual well‑being (Eisenberger & Stinglhamber, 2011; Kurtessis et al., 2017).

# Research Proposition 7

High perceived organizational support will increase the likelihood of (a) initiating unassisted and treatment‑assisted recovery efforts, (b) achieving or sustaining abstinence, and (c) achieving broad recovery outcomes such as growth in positive recovery capital and improved physical, psychological, and social well‑being.

# Conclusion

SUDs represent critical public health and occupational health issues. Evidence suggests that many individuals eventually recover from their SUD and develop productive and meaningful lives. However, the path to recovery is a complex, dynamic, and heterogeneous process that unfolds over time in environmental contexts that can undermine or facilitate SUD recovery initiation and sustainability. An environmental context that broadly affects most adults’ lives is employment. Consistent with this impact, employment represents a critical resource in SUD recovery (e.g., Borrelli et al., 2017; Brown & Ashford, 2019; Grover & Paylor, 2010; Laudet & White, 2010; Monaghan & Wincup, 2013; Room, 1998; Worley, 2017). However, discussions of employment as a SUD recovery resource have not considered that employment also may undermine recovery.

This article’s overall goal was to articulate the potential impact of the employment context in SUDs. To address this goal and inform occupational health researchers and related professionals, we (a) described the nature of a SUD, (b) summarized definitions of SUD recovery and broad themes associated with recovery, (c) developed a working definition of workplace supported recovery, (d) presented a general heuristic model highlighting where work conditions may affect the SUD recovery process, and (e) developed research propositions to guide future research on how two sets of work conditions—workplace recovery hazards and supports—may undermine or facilitate SUD recovery. However, our heuristic model and associated research propositions represent an initial attempt to identify potentially critical directions for occupational health research on workplace supported SUD recovery.

Future research testing and extending the research proposed in this article may provide a better understanding of the positive and negative impact of the work environment on employees’ ability to recover from SUDs. Using a broad set of recovery outcomes, including workplace productivity outcomes, would enhance the bottomline case that employers and employees could benefit if employers directly address SUD recovery. Although the research propositions highlight the general associations of workplace recovery hazards and supports to SUD recovery outcomes, future research needs to uncover which workplace hazards and supports are most central to workplace supported recovery. Moreover, research needs to
