All registered physicians have the right to issue sickness certificates in Sweden, and the vast majority of sick-leave notes are dispensed by general practitioners (GP) within the primary health care system. To provide sufficient and accurate information in the sickness certificate is a challenging task for physicians [25]. In recent years, the economic incentives for the primary health care to involve the employer in rehabilitation have been reinforced. A new function- the rehabilitation coordinator (RC) - has been introduced in all Swedish county councils to support sick-listed patients during their rehabilitation. The very objective with this function is to facilitate patients’ RTW. The RC should also provide the health care system with knowledge about the social insurance system, and coordinate actions between different stakeholders around the patient [26]. The role of the RC is under development and there is yet little guidance on best practice for this new group of primary care professionals [27]. This opens up a window of opportunity to evaluate methods that can be used by the RC to enhance RTW among this large patient group.

Several agreements have been settled at the national level between the government and the Swedish Association of Local Authorities and Regions (SALAR) in order to enhance best practice in primary health care when rehabilitating CMD patients back to work. However, these attempts have been criticized for being ineffective in combatting increasing sick-leave rates [28].

With this study we intend to contribute to knowledge about how primary health care – through the RC- can involve the employer in the rehabilitation of patients with stress-related disorders.

# Methods/Design

# Aim

The overall aim of this study is to evaluate whether a systematic procedure of cooperation between GPs and RCs which involves the employer can reduce the time for RTW in patients with stress-related disorders during a 12-month follow-up period. An intervention group will be compared to treatment as usual (TAU). The primary hypothesis is that an early contact between caregiver, patient and employer can stimulate the employer to take measures at the workplace that advance patients’ RTW. However, we expect this relationship to depend on various circumstances, both at the patient and the organizational level, such as the patient’s symptom severity and motivation to RTW, and the participant GPs’ and RCs’ possibilities to adhere to the intervention.

The second aim of the study is to investigate the organizational prerequisites for primary health care centers (PHCC) to involve the employer at an early stage of rehabilitation. This will be done by a process evaluation, using interviews and register data at the center level.

# Setting

In Sweden, county councils are responsible for providing primary health care. Caregivers that comply with regional standards have the right to provide primary health care, and for a modest fee of € 10, citizens have the right to seek care among both public and private suppliers, funded by public means. One important task for Swedish GPs is to issue the sickness certificates that serve as a basis for social insurance benefit assessments, required from the 8th day of a sick-leave period. A sick-leave certificate must contain a large amount of detailed information, for example about the patient’s diagnosis; functional impairments and activity limitation (work incapacity). The physician can seek advice on appropriate sick-leave durations for different diagnoses in a national decision support, issued by the National Board of Health and Welfare to enhance equal treatment over regions and caregivers. The work capacity must be reduced by at least 25 % for the employee to qualify to sickness benefits. The first fourteen days of a sick-leave period is covered by the employer (except for a first qualifying day), thereafter the Social Insurance Agency takes over the financial responsibility [29]. After 90 days of sick-leave, the agency decides on the right to further payments by assessing the employee’s work capacity in relation to all other work tasks offered by the employer. Further benefits are only granted if there are no such possibilities. The employee has the right to be off duty to try another job, with another employer. At day 180, the employee’s work capacity is evaluated in relation to the entire labour market, but only if it can be assumed that the patient will not be able to return to his or her ordinary job before day 365, or if there are other reasonable conditions that inhibit evaluation. Sickness benefits can compensate for an income loss corresponding to 25 %, 50 %, 75 % or 100 % of the employee´s working hours.

The study is conducted in the Västra Götaland region of Sweden, a large county council covering almost 20 % of the Swedish population with 200 public and private PHCCs. There are about 800 GPs employed at these PHCCs and almost all centers can offer the services of a RC. However, coordinators depend on earmarked national subsidies, and it is common for the coordinator to either work part time as for example a nurse or psychologist, or to work as a coordinator at two or even three centers.

The study is conducted at the Institute of Stress Medicine, Västra Götaland region, and the Department of Work Science and Sociology, University of Gothenburg. It is part of the New Ways research program at the Section for Epidemiology and Social Medicine, Institute of Medicine, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg.
