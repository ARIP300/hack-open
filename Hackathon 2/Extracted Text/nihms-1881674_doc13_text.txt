Negative work conditions.—Drug instrumentalization theory proposes that individuals use psychoactive substances to meet various motivational goals (Muller, 2020; Muller & Schumann, 2011). The evolutionary foundation of instrumentalization theory is that nonaddictive substance use in specific microenvironments can confer benefits by solving proximate adaptive problems (Muller, 2020; Muller & Schumann, 2011). One motivational goal of substance use is self‑medication. The proximate adaptive problem solved by self‑medication is the transition between different mental states—for example, reducing negative mental states associated with adverse work conditions and promoting more positive mental states (Muller, 2020). However, instrumentalization theory also proposes that some vulnerable individuals overuse substances for self‑medication and other goals resulting in escalated use. This chronic increase in substance exposure (higher frequency and quantity of use; use of multiple drugs) among vulnerable individuals leads to changes in brain function that cause behavioral inflexibility and compulsive use, resulting in addiction (i.e., severe SUD) (Muller, 2020; Muller & Schumann, 2011).

Based on instrumentalization theory, the process underlying work‑related self‑medication begins with exposure to negative work conditions (e.g., excessive demands, bullying, job insecurity, hazardous physical work environment, work‑related injuries), which leads to strain (e.g., job dissatisfaction, negative affect, negative perseverative cognition, fatigue, and pain), which then motivates psychoactive substance use to reduce the experienced strain (Frone, 2019). Research supports indirect associations between negative work conditions and increased substance use via various forms of strain, though there is growing evidence that these indirect associations are conditional. In other words, more robust and consistent associations exist between negative work conditions and hazardous substance use (heavy use, workday use) among vulnerable workers predisposed to self‑medicate, such as those with low self‑control, high neuroticism, and high positive outcome expectancies supportive of self‑medication (Frone, 2013, 2019; Grandey et al., 2019).

Exposure to adverse work conditions and resulting strain may exacerbate substance use among those with a current SUD and lead to a recurrence of substance use among those in recovery (Becker, 2012; Sinha, 2012). In other words, individuals with an active SUD may be less likely to initiate treatment and abstinence, whereas those in recovery may fail to maintain these behaviors. The few studies that have examined these issues found that work‑related stressors and negative affect reduced the likelihood of quitting and increased the likelihood of stress‑triggered recurrence of substance use among those who had quit (Albertsen et al., 2006; Siahpush & Carlin, 2006; Strowig, 2000).

Another avenue by which negative work conditions can undermine SUD recovery is weakening recovery capital and the broader well‑being outcomes individuals attempt to develop in recovery. As noted earlier, SUD recovery involves building or rebuilding the internal and external resources (recovery capital) that people can draw upon to support the recovery process and develop healthy, productive, and meaningful lives.
