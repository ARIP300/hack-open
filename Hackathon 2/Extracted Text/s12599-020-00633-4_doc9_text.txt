Private car) poses new challenges for effective and usable access restrictions and controls. It is therefore to be welcomed that GDPR prescribes a minimization of processing and storage of personal data in the interests of data economy and that data must be secured in accordance with the state of the art. Both aspects strengthen access restrictions and minimize the risk of unauthorized access. The general principle that data must be collected and processed for a specific purpose is also to be welcomed. The informed consent of the data subject, which can be revoked at any time, also strengthens control over the data and constitutes an essential cornerstone of informational self-determination.

# 6.2 Prohibition of Coupling and the Right to Unobserved Use

Informational self-determination presupposes the voluntariness of consent. Voluntariness, by nature, requires a prohibition of coupling, meaning that the provision of a service must not depend on consent for the processing of data, or said processing must be limited to the execution of the contract or the provision of the service itself. This should be the guiding principle when designing new services and data-supported business models.

This prohibition of coupling is becoming increasingly important as more and more areas of life are digitized and social participation increasingly depends on the use of digital services. This starts with legally binding services such as networked electricity meters, the eCall service in the car or digitally connected health insurance cards, and continues with the use of more and more important but oligopolistic services such as Google Search, Android/iOS, Facebook, WhatsApp and Amazon for social participation. Due to their importance for social coexistence, it is not possible to speak of voluntary use in the sense of informational self-determination. Accordingly, it should apply in principle that services that are legally obligatory, that are part of services of general interest, or that are central to social participation, must be usable in a way that protects privacy. The question is not whether someone subjectively believes that he or she is actually able to use the service voluntarily, but whether non-use would entail considerable losses for the lives of those affected. In the case of such services, the processing and storage of personal data must be limited to their provision and the execution of contracts. Purposes beyond this must be agreed to by the user and must not be linked to the provision of the service.

# 6.3 Information Rights and Information Asymmetries

The story of Mr. K. in Kafka’s Process can be viewed as a parable about the negative consequences of automated decision-making processes in times of AI and Big Data: He is arrested without being aware of any guilt. Above all, he is not told why he was charged and how he could justify himself.

In research on computer supported collaborative work (CSCW), the meaning of the “I understand how the other understands me” principle has long been known. It is an important prerequisite for social action to coordinate, to negotiate roles and, as in K.’s case, to justify or claim justifications. Here lies the essential strength and progress of the GDPR: not to reduce data protection to the term “privacy”, which is common in the English-speaking world, but to develop it further in the direction of digital consumer protection. The aim is transparency as to how government agencies and companies use personal data and how data-supported decisions are made. In particular, the regulation regarding the right to access data and the right of consumers not to be subject to automated processing – including profiling – should be mentioned here.

In future, however, both rights should be developed more consistently towards the above “I understand how the other understands me” principle in order to reduce information asymmetry. Knowing what data is collected about you is only the first step. In order to adequately assess risks, it is necessary to make (semi-)automated decision-making processes and their procedures transparent for those affected, as well as to be able to control the associated systems through an independent body.

# 6.4 Standardized, Machine-Readable Consumer Data

The provision of data in machine-readable, standardized formats is important from the point of view of consumers in two respects. On the one hand, this reduces lock-in effects and opens up new possibilities for consumers to provide this data to other value-added service providers (e.g., fitness trackers and shopping histories can be used by general practitioners and nutritionists to provide more targeted information on healthy lifestyles). On the other hand, consumers can make this data available to so-called legal-tech service providers so that these can easily enforce their rights, cancel contracts or change suppliers on behalf of consumers.

# 6.5 Implementation and Research Needs

A number of practical problems have been identified during implementation, such as how to ensure that data subjects are well informed, how to avoid a flood of information when using dozens of services, and how to implement information management in practice by keeping (revoked) consents, purposes and data consistent and up to date. The situation is made more difficult by the fact that
