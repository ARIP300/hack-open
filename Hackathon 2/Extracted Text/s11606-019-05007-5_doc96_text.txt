# RESULTS:

Of 296 patients completed diabetes education between 2015 and 2018, 139 patients (46%) met inclusion criteria. The mean age was 58, and 58% were female. The mean Hgba1c was 7.2±1.4 prior to the class and 6.6±1.1 at the next measured Hgba1c at least 3 months after taking the class (p < .001 for change). No significant difference was seen in impact of intervention between men (-0.57 ±1.4) or women (-0.59±1.1).

# CONCLUSIONS:

In this patient population, diabetes education classes produced a statistically significant and clinically meaningful reduction in Hgba1c. Our findings are limited by our inclusion criteria for patients with pre- and post-education Hgba1c; this population had a relatively low baseline Hgba1c and the impact of the behavioral intervention may be exaggerated by unmeasured confounders that also led to adherence with lab monitoring. Future research should be done to assess the impact of diabetes education classes on other populations.

# DOES HOSPITAL TEACHING STATUS INFLUENCE RISK FACTORS AND INCIDENCE RATE OF 30-DAY READMISSION FOR ATRIAL FIBRILLATION

# BACKGROUND:

Atrial Fibrillation (AF) is a common arrhythmia accounting for nearly 1/3 of all cardiac rhythm admissions with hospital admissions for AF increasing by 70% over the past several years [1]. Furthermore, previous literature suggests that teaching hospitals may have higher readmission rates compared to non-teaching hospitals [2]. We sought out to determine the 30-day all-cause readmission rate for adults (age >= 18) admitted with a principal diagnosis of AF and compare the risk factors for teaching and non-teaching metropolitan hospitals.

# METHODS:

We utilized Agency of Healthcare Research and Quality's (AHRQ) 2014 Nationwide Readmission Database which includes 14.9 Million discharges across 22 states to identify admissions with a principal diagnosis of Atrial Fibrillation using ICD-9 code 427.31. Applicable admissions were all adults (age >=18) with an index hospitalization discharge between January 1 to November 30, 2014. Patients who died during index admission and those with missing covariates were excluded. Index admissions to non-metropolitan hospital were excluded. All-cause including Atrial Fibrillation readmissions within 30-days of an Atrial Fibrillation were analyzed. Statistical analysis was completed with Stata 15 (StataCorp, College Station, TX) with p-values < 0.05 considered statistically significant. A univariate and multivariate analysis of data collected was completed using both odds ratio and chi square test for significance. Predictors for readmission were determined using a multivariate logistic regression model following sequential step-wise elimination of covariates including demographics, comorbidities, hospital characteristics, length of stay (LOS) for index admission, and the modified Elixhauser Comorbidity Index.

# RESULTS:

A total of 127,156 patients met criteria for inclusion. There was 21,384 readmissions (overall rate 16.82%) within 30-days of the index admission. Of the 21,384 readmissions, 5,589 (26.17%) had a principal diagnosis of Atrial Fibrillation. Metropolitan teaching hospitals had an overall readmission rate of 14.43% compared to 14.32% of non-teaching metropolitan hospitals (not statistically significant). Multivariate analysis showed that for metropolitan hospitals in general, younger age, weekend admissions, association with renal failure, Medicaid insurance, different disposition at discharge (including leaving AMA, going home with home health or to a short-term hospital or other facility) all increased the odds for 30-day readmission from Atrial Fibrillation.

# CONCLUSIONS:

In general, nearly 1 in 6 patients discharged with a principal diagnosis of Atrial Fibrillation will be readmitted within 30 days. Metropolitan teaching and non-teaching hospitals have similar readmission rates and profile. Provider awareness of risk factors for readmissions in metropolitan hospitals will allow for the development of interventions to decrease future morbidity and mortality.

# DOES HOSPITAL TEACHING STATUS INFLUENCE RISK FACTORS AND INCIDENCE RATE OF 30-DAY READMISSION FOR CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE IN THE UNITED STATES?

# BACKGROUND:

Congestive Heart Failure (CHF) admissions continue to rise with nearly 1 Million hospitalizations annually [1]. Furthermore, previous literature suggests that teaching hospitals may have higher readmission rates compared to non-teaching hospitals [2]. We sought out to determine the 30-day all-cause readmission rate for adults (age >= 18) admitted with a principal diagnosis of CHF and compare the risk factors for readmission at teaching and non-teaching metropolitan hospitals.

# METHODS:

We utilized Agency of Healthcare Research and Quality's (AHRQ) 2014 Nationwide Readmission Database which includes 14.9 Million discharges across 22 states to identify admissions with a principal diagnosis of CHF using ICD-9 codes (402.01, 402.11, 402.91, 404.01, 404.11, 404.03, 404.13, 404.91, 404.93 and 428.XX). Applicable admissions were all adults (age >= 18) with an index hospitalization discharge between January 1 to November 30, 2014. Patients who died during index admission and those with missing covariates were excluded. All index admissions to non-metropolitan hospital were excluded. All-cause including CHF readmissions within 30-days of a CHF readmission were analyzed. Statistical analysis was completed with Stata 15 (StataCorp, College Station, TX) with p-values < 0.05 considered statistically significant. A univariate and multivariate analysis of data collected was completed using both odds ratio and chi square tests for significance. Predictors for readmission were determined using a multivariate logistic regression model following sequential step-wise elimination of covariates including demographics, comorbidities, hospital characteristics, length of stay (LOS) for index admission, and the modified Elixhauser Comorbidity Index.

# RESULTS:

A total of 354,681 patients met criteria for inclusion. Of which, there was 78,588 readmissions (overall rate 22.15%) within 30-days of the index admission. Of the 78,588 readmissions, 31,030 (39.48%) had a principal diagnosis of CHF. Metropolitan teaching hospitals had an overall readmission rate of 22.203% compared to 22.06% at non-teaching metropolitan hospitals with the difference not statistically significant. Multivariate analysis showed that for metropolitan hospitals in general increased odds for 30-day readmission from CHF were weekend admissions, younger, any different disposition at discharge than routine (other facility, short term hospital, with home health, and leaving AMA), Medicaid as payer, central metropolitan areas with population >1 million, longer LOS, and lower household income.
