# Impact of PDMP Mandates on Opioid Discontinuation

Despite concerns about inappropriately abrupt opioid discontinuation resulting from this policy, no studies have evaluated the extent to which this occurs. Our objective was to evaluate the impact of PDMP mandates on discontinuation of chronic opioid prescribing for Veterans managed in the Veterans Affairs Administration (VA) Healthcare System.

# METHODS

We conducted an interrupted time-series (ITS) study of opioid discontinuation in Veterans without cancer diagnoses in 4 states that implemented a PDMP use mandate from 2010-2014: Ohio (OH; Nov 2011), West Virginia (WV; Jun 2013), Kentucky (KY; Jul 2012), and Tennessee (TN; Apr 2013). We used Veterans in neighboring states without a mandate as controls. We built monthly cohorts of Veterans with 305 days of a VA-prescribed opioid in the prior 365 days. We defined discontinuation as a 90-day period without a VA prescribed opioid. For each state with a PMDP mandate and its pooled control we estimated monthly discontinuation rates adjusted for patient-level demographic and clinical covariates. We calculated the difference between the mandate states and their controls; and we used these differences in our ITS models with offset and slope-change terms at the time of the mandate. We included 12-months prior to and following the mandate in each state. All reported percentages represent absolute percentage points.

# RESULTS

We built monthly cohorts for 4 PMDP mandate and 12 neighboring control states (3-7 controls for each mandated state). Monthly cohort sizes ranged from 4,733-8,909 Veterans in the mandate states and 11,985-41,163 in the controls, a total of 2.5M veteran-months. The average adjusted discontinuation rates in the 12 months prior to (after) the mandates were 0.7 (0.9)% in OH, 0.7 (0.7)% in WV, 0.8 (1.3)% in KY, and 0.8 (0.9)% in TN. There was no difference in the pre-mandate discontinuation rate between mandate states and controls. TN was the only state with an increasing baseline trend in discontinuation compared to its control of 0.02%/month (p=0.03). KY's mandate was associated with an immediate 1.03% (p<0.001) increase in discontinuation rate. Mandates in KY and TN were associated with a decreasing trend in discontinuation of -0.09% (p=0.001) and -0.05% (p<0.001) per month respectively. There was no change associated with the mandates in OH or WV.

# CONCLUSIONS

For VA managed Veterans, state laws mandating prescriber PDMP use had little absolute effect on discontinuation of chronic opioid prescribing. We did observe a clinically significant but short lived increase in opioid discontinuation in KY immediately following its mandate, however the overall discontinuation rate remained low. These results suggest that PDMP use mandates did not cause abrupt discontinuation of long-term opioid therapy within VA.

# ASSOCIATION OF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PATIENT-CENTERED MEDICAL HOME WITH QUALITY OF LIFE IN PATIENTS WITH MULTIMORBIDITY

(Control ID #3165054)

# BACKGROUND

The patient-centered medical home (PCMH) has clinical benefits for patients with multimorbidity, yet the association with patient-reported outcomes such as health-related quality of life (HRQoL) is unknown. Therefore, we examined the association of the Veterans Affairs (VA) implementation of the PCMH model, the Patient Aligned Care Team (PACT), and HRQoL in multimorbid adults.

# METHODS

We performed a retrospective cohort study of multimorbid patients (2 or more chronic diseases in 2 or more body systems, n = 22,095) who responded to a patient experiences survey in 2013-2014 and received VA primary care in 2012. PCMH implementation at a clinic was measured in 2012 with the validated PACT Implementation Progress Index (PI2); Higher PI2 scores indicate better performance on 8 domains (access; care continuity; care coordination; comprehensiveness; self-management support; communication; shared decision-making; and team-based care). HRQoL was measured from the patient survey with Short Form-12 physical and mental component scores (PCS, MCS). Surveys were weighted to the VA population. Generalized estimating equations, adjusted for patient and clinic characteristics, were used to model HRQoL against 1) quintiles of PI2 as the primary exposure, 2) highest and lowest versus mid-quartiles of PI2 in exploratory analyses of the 8 PI2 domains, and 3) an interaction analysis of patients with and without hospitalizations in 2012.

# RESULTS

The cohort was mostly male (96%) and on average 68 years old with 4.4 chronic diagnoses. Compared to patients seen at the lowest-scoring PI2 clinics, receiving care in the highest PI2 clinics was associated with a 3.0 point higher adjusted marginal mean PCS [42.7 vs. 39.7, P<0.001)], but a 1.2 point lower MCS [36.3 vs. 35.1, P=0.04]. Patients with prior hospitalizations seen in clinics with higher compared to lower PI2 scores had a 2.6 point greater MCS (P=0.02); Those without prior hospitalizations seen in higher compared to lower PI2 clinics had an MCS that was 1.6 points lower (P<0.01). Better performance on the communication and shared decision-making domains was significantly associated with a higher mean PCS (1.0 points higher for average versus lowest PI2 for communication, P=0.018; 0.9 points higher for average versus lowest PI2 for shared decision-making, P<0.01).

# CONCLUSIONS

Multimorbid patients seen in clinics with greater PCMH implementation reported a clinically significant higher physical HRQoL, which may be due to better patient-provider communication and shared decision-making. Care from higher performing clinics was associated with a small but not clinically significant lower score for mental HRQoL, which may be related to disease severity as measured by hospitalizations. Our findings add HRQoL to the known benefits of the PCMH model.

# ASSOCIATION OF USE OF THE NEJM KNOWLEDGE+ PRODUCT AND PERFORMANCE ON THE ABIM IM-MOC EXAM

Duhigg 3; Bradley Gray 3. 1 Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA; 2 NEJM Group, Waltham, MA; 3 American Board of Internal Medicine, Philadelphia, PA. (Control ID #3165130)

# BACKGROUND

Internal medicine physicians who are completing their American Board of Internal Medicine Internal Medicine Maintenance of Certification (ABIM IM-MOC) requirements must eventually pass a knowledge assessment (i.e., MOC examination). Although physicians have many options to choose from as they prepare for this assessment, including the NEJM Knowledge+ Internal Medicine Board Review (NEJM Knowledge+) product, there exists no research related to the use of this or other similar study aids and MOC examination performance.

# METHODS

To address this gap, we compared ABIM IM-MOC examination performance among similar physicians who did and did not use NEJM Knowledge+. Our physician sample included 177 physicians who attempted an ABIM IM-MOC examination from 2014-2017 and completed at least 75% of the NEJM Knowledge+ product prior to the ABIM IM-MOC examination and 177 matched.
