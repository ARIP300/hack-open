# Discussion

From the perspective of Chinese hospital workers, we explore the relationship between CHRP, PEI, PEA and their PEB, as well as whether there is the mediating effect played by PEI and PEA. This study generates several results and makes significant contributions in the field of environmental protection and sustainable development.

First, numerous agendas from the level of national and international have realized the severity of climate change117. To reverse the tendency of climate change and improve human health, more and more researches focus on the relationship between CHRP and PEB, additionally, PEA and PEI have been extensively used in previous research. However, most of the research about PEB is conducted in developed countries such as the USA 118, Sweden119, Spain120, and Britain 121, little is known in developing country, which is a deficiency and is obviously magnified in China. Meanwhile, the health effects due to climate change are continuously accelerating in China122. The hospital plays a crucial role in protecting health, meanwhile, it also releases a large amount of greenhouse gases leading to climate change through energy consumption, transportation, and product disposal 123. Hence, this study explored the influencing factor of Chinese hospital workers’ PEB. From the test result of hypothesis 2, we found that CHRP has significant impacts on PEA, which indicates that hospital workers’ understanding of the current environmental situation and their perceptions of the health risk related to climate change are important promoting factors in terms of their environmental attitude. This finding is consistent with the previous research by Bradley, Babutsidze 124, who compared residents from Australia and France, and claimed that risk perception can indirectly predict environmental behaviors. Additionally, Carducci, Fiore 125 also indicated that the attitudes towards pro-environmental behaviors are positively related to health risk perception among Italian University Students. Moreover, we found that CHRP also significantly positively affects PEI among hospital workers. This is consistent with the views of Yoon, Jeong 68 and Ataei, Gholamrezai 126. Specifically, Yoon, Jeong 68 indicated that risk perception of ocean microplastics significantly affects pro-environmental behavioral intention of tourists. Ataei, Gholamrezai126 demonstrated that farmers’ intention to use green pesticides can be explained by health beliefs including perceived benefits, perceived risk, cues to action, and motivation. According to the test result of hypothesis 5, we inferred that PEI has significant positive impacts on PEB, which conforms to the TPB that suggests behavioral intention is a direct predictor variable that can effectively explain and promote actual behaviors24. Chin, Jiang127 mentioned that increasing customers’ environmental intention can motivate them to use green cosmetic products. However, Wang and Mangmeechai 128 suggested that there is an intention–behavior gap in the field of waste sorting and management, Chinese citizens’ environmental intentions have increased, but their actual behaviors may not change accordingly.

Second, based on the test result of hypothesis 1, it indicated that higher CHRP can not necessarily bring about more actual PEB of hospital workers. In previous studies, many scholars have convinced that risk perception has a direct and intimate relationship with environmental behavior. For example, Zeng, Jiang 129 found that an individual’s pro-environmental behavior can be influenced by environmental risk perception and cultural worldviews. Truelove and Gillis 86 also found that laypeople’s perceptions in terms of environmental impact and health are tightly related to PEB. However, several studies have shown that the direct relationship between CHRP and PEB is not significant and can be easily influenced by other factors. Yu, Chang130 found that social norm is a dominant mediator in regulating the relationship between risk perception and pro-environmental behavior. Maartensson and Loi131 pointed out that risk perception is positively associated with behavioral willingness that is positively associated with pro-environmental behavior, this indirect effect between risk perception and pro-environmental behavior is significant. Hence, it is reasonable to claim that individuals’ CHRP alone is unable to fully transform into actual PEB, the top priority is to find more variables that can strengthen or weaken this relationship. Different individuals have different perceptions when encountering the same risks132. Hospital workers are regarded as guardians of human health, more and more scholars have put their attention to clarify the obstacles and stimuli behind their health risk perception and environmental behavior, which includes demographic characteristics, cognition, emotion, and culture 19,133–135. Additionally, hospital workers are not well informed about the health.
