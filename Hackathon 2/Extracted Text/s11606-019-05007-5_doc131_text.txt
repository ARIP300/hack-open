# FROM THE #METOO FRONTLINES: INCOMING INTERNS REPORT A BREADTH OF EXPERIENCES RELATED TO SEXUAL HARASSMENT IN MEDICAL SCHOOL

# BACKGROUND:

The prevalence of sexual harassment in medicine has recently been in the spotlight, with up to 30% of female physicians reporting sexual harassment in the workplace. There is also increasing recognition that the spectrum of sex discrimination includes microaggressions, the prevalence of which have yet to be elucidated. Medical students are a particularly vulnerable population within medicine as they experience the widest power differentials and their ongoing grades and evaluations deepen the consequences of retaliation to reporting. With the influence of the #MeToo movement, a few medical school deans have seen an increase in reporting, but most schools report stagnant (and low) reporting rates, indicating that sexual harassment may still be under-represented in the current reporting system. We aimed to study the ways in which medical students experienced sexual harassment in medicine.

# METHODS:

An in-person cross-sectional survey was administered to incoming interns at UPMC about their experience with sexual harassment in medical school. An optional question invited respondents to share experiences of sexual harassment in free-text form. The reports were examined for common themes.

# RESULTS:

185 graduates of U.S. medical schools returned the survey, with 42 completing the optional free-text question ("If you are willing and interested in sharing any of your experiences, please use the space below"). Of these, 33 respondents identified as female, and 9 as male. Analysis of the responses revealed six recurring themes: (1) decision not to report, (2) unsuccessful reporting, (3) disproportionate "scut" work for female students, (4) inappropriate comments and touching, (5) repeat offenders with well-known reputations, and (6) male patients harassing female students. This last theme was particularly attributed to Veterans Administration (VA) patients.

# CONCLUSIONS:

More female students than male students shared negative experiences. They identified a breadth of experiences attributed to both colleagues/superiors and patients. Most importantly, many students identified the current reporting system as discouraging of reporting. Given the variety of experiences shared by incoming trainees, tackling sexual harassment must evolve from a single broad campaign to targeted approaches for each of these issues. The current reporting system appears to be insufficient and reforms are needed to develop an improved system that encourages and supports trainees to report inappropriate experiences.

# RESULTS:

Overall, 26 participants completed interviews; 42.3% were female, 73.1% were non-white, and mean age was 47.0 (sd=15.3). The median number of admissions in past year was 8.5 (interquartile range 6.0 - 11.0). Four main themes emerged. First, major medical problems were universal but the onset of frequent hospital use varied, such that some participants had experienced periods of high hospital use throughout their lifetime, while others experienced high hospital use as an adult. Second, participants perceived fluctuations in their course of illness to be related to psychological, social, and economic factors. Social support was perceived as helpful and participants benefitted when providing social support to others. Third, episodes of illness could range from sudden onset to a gradual onset of symptoms, but generally seemed uncontrollable and often unpredictable to the participant. Fourth, participants strongly desired to avoid hospitalization and typically sought care only after self-management failed.

# CONCLUSIONS:

Emergent themes pointed to factors that influence patients' onset of high hospital use, fluctuations in their illness over time, and triggers to seek care during an episode of illness. These findings enable patients' perspectives to be incorporated into the design of programs serving similar populations of frequently hospitalized patients.
