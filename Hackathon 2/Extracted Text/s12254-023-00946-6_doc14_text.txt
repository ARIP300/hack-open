# iwCLL 2023

As Dr. Mawalla reported, tremendous achievements on some of these objectives have already been obtained. Capacity building program in Tanzania. William Frank Mawalla, MD, Muhimbili University of Health and Allied Sciences, Daressalam, Tanzania, presented an update on the iwCLL Capacity Building Pilot Program that was initiated in Tanzania in March 2022 to improve treatment outcomes in patients with CLL. Four objectives have been defined that include promotion of practical training in flow cytometry and TP53 mutation analysis, training of clinicians and nurses, provision of clinical supervision and mentorship in multidisciplinary team meetings, and clinical research capacity building.

Laboratory scientists and hematologists have been trained in flow panel setting and interpretation, as well as NGS TP53 and IGHV mutation analysis. A clinical CLL guideline that reflects local needs and takes the diagnostic capacity into account is currently under review before being adopted into national guidelines. This went hand in hand with the development of key laboratory SOPs on both immunophenotyping and molecular analysis. To date, 32 patients have been enrolled. Dr. Mawalla expressed hope that this database will outlive the program and will continue to serve as a model for other malignancies beyond CLL. In addition, the experts actively engage in advocacy activities. Numerous dissemination events are being held both inside and outside of the university, and efforts are united to engage key stakeholders and supporting patient groups.

# Different perspectives on how to define success in CLL

Fortunately, the landscape of CLL treatment has dramatically transformed over the last ten years, shifting from chemotherapy to new targeted therapies. These advancements have not only extended patients' lifespans but also often enhanced their quality of life. Consequently, many patients now undergo continuous treatment throughout their lives and frequently pass away from causes unrelated to CLL. At this year’s iwCLL, there was a debate and roundtable on how to define success in CLL. From a physician's perspective, how is success in CLL treatment defined?

The debate and roundtable aimed to facilitate a discussion, allowing participants to exchange a wide array of viewpoints on the diversity in CLL treatment approaches and perspectives since there is not a 'one-size-fits-all' solution in this context. With years of experience in treating people with CLL, I have adopted a long-term approach. Recognizing the chronic nature of CLL, it is important to consider minimizing the cumulative burden of the disease and its treatments over time. Therefore, the goal is not just long-term survival, but achieving it with minimal adverse impact from the disease and its treatment.

Having delved into the physician's perspective on the evolving landscape of CLL treatment and its implications for success, it becomes equally important to consider the other side of this equation. The patient's experience and viewpoint are crucial in shaping our understanding of treatment effectiveness and quality of life. With this in mind, how do patients typically perceive their journey through CLL treatment, and what factors do they consider when defining success in their treatment and overall wellbeing?

One key observation in CLL treatment is the variability and evolution of patient perspectives. These viewpoints are uniquely personal and can shift significantly over time. For example, a patient might initially focus on a short-term goal, like being healthy for a significant event.
