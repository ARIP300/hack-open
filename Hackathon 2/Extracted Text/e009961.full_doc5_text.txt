same circumstances. Recently, several studies have been conducted on the topic of disclosure of mental illness in the workplace. For instance, a decision aid for employees on whether or not to disclose their mental health problems to an employer has been developed, which has been shown to effectively reduce decisional conflict in employees with mental health problems. The findings of the present and other studies suggest that future programmes aimed at reducing stigma and discrimination should also involve stakeholders from the environment such as employers and occupational health professionals as they play a major role in, for instance, whether or not temporary workplace reasonable adjustments or accommodations are made. Boot et al showed that workplace adjustments are associated with a reduction in sick leave duration and that 43% of workers with mental health problems reported a need for work adjustments.

The results of this study indicated that in very highly developed countries, significantly higher percentages of workplace discrimination were reported as compared to countries with a low/medium developmental score. These findings differ from those of an intercultural study on employers’ attitudes towards hiring and accommodating a person with disabilities at work. Here, it was found that Chinese employers were less likely to endorse hiring people with psychiatric disabilities than employers from the USA or Hong Kong. However, it should be noticed that within one HDI group, many different countries and cultures are represented which limits generalisability.

Whereas the size of this study, including 35 countries, is a considerable strength, the number of people interviewed per country was too small to draw any conclusion at country level. Nevertheless, the results indicated that even in countries with a medium to low developmental score, about one-third of participants reported discrimination in the work setting. Future research should focus on differences between countries and study, for instance, the effects of legislation. However, legislation will not entirely solve the problem, as legislation does not address self-stigma and also in countries with more advanced equality legislation experienced workplace discrimination rates were still high.

We also found that experienced workplace discrimination was significantly related to unemployment. These findings are similar to those of a large household interview survey in six European countries. Specifically, they found that in participants with a mental health problem, perceived stigma was significantly associated with being unemployed, as well as with a decreased quality of life, higher work and role limitations and higher social limitations. An explanation for the finding that experienced workplace discrimination was independently related to unemployment is that the social stigma attached to mental health problems among employers may hinder them from hiring an employee with MDD.
