# LEARNING OBJECTIVE #2:

Recognize insulin infusion and apheresis as definitive therapies for hypertriglyceridemia-induced pancreatitis

# CASE:

A 45-year-old man with a history of hyperlipidemia and gout presented to the emergency room with dizziness for 1 day. He reported having epigastric discomfort and black tarry stools intermittently for 2 weeks. He endorsed taking ibuprofen during this time. Social history was notable for heavy use of alcohol (15-20 drinks of vodka weekly). Physical exam was notable for tachycardia, orthostatic hypotension, and epigastric pain. In addition, generalized pallor and mild scleral icterus were noted. Laboratory investigations revealed anemia (hemoglobin 10.3 g/dL), abnormal liver function tests (alanine aminotransferase 725 U/L, aspartate aminotransferase 763 U/L and alkaline phosphatase 419 U/L), elevated lipase (173 U/L) and lactic acidosis (lactate 6.1 mmol/L). He was admitted to general medicine for further management. Questioning the etiology of the elevated lipase, the work-up was expanded to evaluate for acute pancreatitis including a fasting lipid panel. Results were notable for a serum triglyceride level of 2,923 mg/dl. Insulin infusion along with dextrose 5% plus sodium chloride 0.45% infusion was started and the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit. Apheresis was tentatively planned. The following day, serum triglycerides had improved to 820 mg/dl and epigastric discomfort had resolved. Subsequently, he underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy which showed a clean-based gastric ulcer and hypertensive portal gastropathy. Endoscopic ultrasonography of the biliary tree was only notable for biliary sludge but negative for any calculi or mass lesion. His serum triglyceride levels continued to improve and he was subsequently discharged from the hospital.

# IMPACT/DISCUSSION:

Hypertriglyceridemia is the third most common of acute pancreatitis after alcoholic and biliary pancreatitis. Serum triglycerides undergo hydrolysis by pancreatic lipase to form free fatty acids which induce free radical injury to the pancreatic parenchyma. Generally, acute pancreatitis is attributable to hypertriglyceridemia if the serum triglyceride level is greater than 1,000 mg/dl. In rare cases, serum lipase may be falsely normal. Management of hypertriglyceridemia-induced acute pancreatitis is similar to that for other causes of pancreatitis with the caveat that additional interventions are needed to normalize serum triglyceride levels. Insulin infusion and/or apheresis are two commonly used modalities to normalize serum triglyceride levels.

# CONCLUSION:

In patients with heavy alcohol use and epigastric pain, pancreatitis due to hypertriglyceridemia must be considered in the differential diagnosis. Insulin infusion and apheresis are the two definitive therapies employed to normalize serum triglyceride levels.

# WEIGHT LOSS IN A SALVADORAN WOMAN: THROUGH THE MIGRATION LENS

Jordana Laks. Boston University School of Medicine, Dorchester, MA. (Control ID #3186366)

# LEARNING OBJECTIVE #1:

Recognize the health consequences of recent migration

# LEARNING OBJECTIVE #2:

Assess for trauma in an immigrant patient

# CASE:

A 34-year-old woman from El Salvador presented to a community health center for unintentional weight loss. She reported losing an unknown amount of weight over the past month such that her clothes felt looser. She denied any appetite change, fevers, night sweats, heat intolerance, or gastrointestinal symptoms. When asked about depression symptoms, she endorsed tearfulness and difficulty sleeping since her arrival in the United States three weeks ago. Past medical history and family history were non-contributory. She did not take any medications and denied smoking, alcohol, or drug use. She was currently living with her uncle and searching for work as a tailor. On physical exam, the patient's weight was 134 pounds, down about 10 pounds from her self-reported usual weight, with a normal body mass index of 23 kg/m2. She had a sad and blunted affect. Basic laboratory tests were unremarkable except for a mild normocytic anemia. At her one-month follow-up appointment, the patient disclosed that she fled her home because of gang violence. She had witnessed gang members kill her brother and niece. She and her daughter walked most of the way on their journey from El Salvador. They had limited access to food, water, and shelter. She was worried about her financial insecurity and distressed by thoughts of family members still in El Salvador. The patient was seen by a mental health provider with trauma expertise. She declined antidepressant pharmacotherapy. She was informed of local resources for free and low-cost food.

# IMPACT/DISCUSSION:

Refugees in the United States may present to primary care settings with symptoms triggered by migration and trauma. In this case, the patient's unintentional weight loss occurred after her physically arduous journey from El Salvador with poor access to food. This case illustrates the importance of opening a dialogue about the patient's reason for leaving their home country and details of their journey. In recent years, increasing numbers of families from El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala are arriving in the U.S. fleeing gang violence and extreme poverty. The World Health Organization has described health harms during migration including deprivation, extreme weather exposure, accidental injuries, and physical and sexual violence. History of trauma is particularly common among Central American migrants. In one study of families arriving at the United States-Mexico border, 83% of participants cited violence as a reason for migration and 32% met criteria for post-traumatic stress disorder. Recent immigrants may be hesitant to disclose trauma due to avoidance of painful emotions and/or fear of political persecution and stigma.

# CONCLUSION:

Health care providers should ask about prior physical and mental trauma when seeing newly arrived immigrant patients regardless of their chief complaints.

# WERNICKE'S ENCEPHALOPATHY FROM POOR NUTRITIONAL INTAKE PRESENTING AS ACUTE ONSET APHASIA

Saloni Kapoor; Danica Smith; Kristin Berger. University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, Pittsburgh, PA. (Control ID #3184236)

# LEARNING OBJECTIVE #1:

Suspect Wernicke's encephalopathy in elderly patients presenting with acute onset encephalopathy

# CASE:

Mrs S is an 82 years old female with history of left parietal lobe meningioma status post resection 1 year back complicated by partial seizures, hypertension, peripheral vascular disease, a stable 4mm left PICA aneurysm and an admission 6 months back for post ictal confusion who presented with acute onset aphasia, confusion, and difficulty ambulating. Patient lives and functions independently at baseline and was last seen normal the night before presentation. In the ED, her vitals and labs were unremarkable. NIH stroke score was 17. CT head was negative for acute pathology. CTA Head and neck without major occlusion, no significant change in 4 mm left PICA aneurysm. MRI brain demonstrated restricted diffusion/enhancement of the left hippocampal cortex. EEG showed left temporal periodic lateralizing epileptic discharges but no seizure activity. TSH, thyroid antibody, HgbA1c were within normal limits. A lumbar puncture demonstrated tube 4 with 2 WBC, 0 RBC, 120 glucose, 68 protein. Subsequently HSV, CMV, VZV, WNV, paraneoplastic panel and anti thyroid antibodies came back negative. Vitamin B1 level was reported as undetectable. She was started on IV Thiamine supplementation. After 3 days she had complete resolution of aphasia. She had reduced her food intake over the past few months as she
