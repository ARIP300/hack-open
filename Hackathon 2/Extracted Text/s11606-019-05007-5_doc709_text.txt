# Transition to Attending Elective

Hospitalist-based rotations to ease this transition (Ludwin et al. Journal of Hospital Medicine, 2018). Further, of the rotations offered, the majority focus on quality improvement/high value care or enhancing clinical skills. These rotations generally do not have a targeted curriculum focused on higher level health systems attending skills.

# Curricular Objectives:

- Discover challenges and opportunities of working as the attending physician on interdisciplinary teams
- Provide an opportunity for residents to oversee direct patient care and conduct independent rounds with an advanced practice provider (APP)
- Develop practice patterns and leadership skills for independent practice in conjunction with an APP

# SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS:

This study involves Internal Medicine PGY-3s who have participated in the "Transition to Attending" Elective, APPs at Pennsylvania Presbyterian Medical Center, and current hospitalist faculty members within the University of Pennsylvania Health System.

# DESCRIPTION:

We developed a novel, two-week "Transition to Attending" elective in which third-year Internal Medicine residents assume the responsibility of an attending hospitalist, lead a team of APPs, and receive personalized training on high-yield elements of independent clinical practice (teaching on rounds, hospital systems, billing/documentation, Point of Care Ultrasound, leadership skills, and interprofessional best practices) from expert clinical educators. Residents work with an APP providing direct patient care while the attending of records sees patients separately and provides higher level feedback on systems based skills.

# EVALUATION:

From November 2017 to date, 7 residents completed the 2 week rotation and associated post-rotation survey. Two of the study authors analyzed this qualitative data to identify themes regarding the rotation's strengths, areas for improvement, and resident perception of preparedness for independent practice.

# DISCUSSION / REFLECTION / LESSONS LEARNED:

We found that this elective filled a gap in providing residents a true clinical experience working with APPs on higher level skills with deliberate feedback focusing on the transition to becoming an attending hospitalist. Residents identified that they did not realize how independent APPs are clinically and spent much of their time developing shared patient work flows. Our total number of participants is small but overall feedback shows that this has been a high yield rotation with an appropriate balance of patient care and acquisition of practical knowledge.

# FEEDBACK ON GENERAL MEDICINE ROTATIONS: RECONCILING TWO PERSPECTIVES

# NEEDS AND OBJECTIVES:

The objective of our study was to unveil and understand differences in perceived frequency and quality of feedback between hospitalists and residents with the ultimate goal of improving the system and culture of effective feedback on general medical floors.

# SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS:

Our surveys were for residents who had completed at least 1 month of general medicine wards and hospitalists on teaching services.

# DESCRIPTION:

During October 2018, 114 internal medicine residents/preliminary medicine interns and 50 hospitalists were surveyed. The surveys included 14-16 similar questions for residents and hospitalists regarding feedback.

# EVALUATION:

Forty seven out of 114 residents responded to our survey while 26/50 hospitalists completed the survey. There was broad agreement of what constituted effective feedback with >55% of both groups agreeing that it should be specific, timely, and include both positive and negative feedback. Of note, only 10.6% of residents thought that avoiding criticism was an important component of feedback. Regarding the frequency of feedback, 84.6% of hospitalists reported giving end of rotation feedback 75-100% of the time whereas 44.7% of residents reported receiving it that often. Regarding mid-rotation feedback, 57.7% of hospitalists reported giving it at least 50-100% of the time whereas only 32.6% of residents reported receiving it that often. A total of 37% of residents reported receiving mid-rotation feedback 0-25% of the time. Regarding feedback in general other than at the end of the rotation, 57.7% of hospitalists reported giving feedback either daily or every few days compared to 8.5% of residents reporting receiving feedback that often. On average, hospitalists rated themselves as 6.6/10 while residents rated the feedback as 6.1/10. Overall, 44.7% of residents reported being told "keep up the good work" or to "continue reading" without additional specific feedback. Regarding challenges to giving feedback, 76.8% of hospitalists reported time constraints, 42.3% reported difficulty with negative feedback, and 38.5% reported lack of enough direct observation of residents.

# DISCUSSION / REFLECTION / LESSONS LEARNED:

Both residents and hospitalists agree that feedback is important and that a more robust culture of feedback is desired. Our project shows that there are large discrepancies between the perceived frequency of giving/receiving feedback between hospitalists and residents. Of particular interest, residents want more specific and negative feedback even as hospitalists acknowledged their own discomfort with giving constructive criticism. Other challenges cited by hospitalists include time constraints and not enough direct observation of residents. Improving the culture of feedback at any institution will require a deliberate and collaborative effort between residents and attendings. By reconciling both perspectives, this project serves as a starting point for our institution towards achieving that goal.

# FILLING THE GAP: A GERIATRICS AND PALLIATIVE CARE LEADERSHIP NEEDS ASSESSMENT

# NEEDS AND OBJECTIVES:

By 2030, those over the age of 85 will double to about 10 million. Despite this demographic imperative, there is a significant shortage in geriatricians and palliative care specialists. To best utilize this scarce, specialty resource, we propose the development of an elite workforce of future geriatrics and palliative care leaders who will lead health systems to best meet the needs of a vulnerable, aging population. Currently, there are no leadership curricula developed for Geriatric and Palliative Care fellows. Therefore, a needs assessment was conducted as an initial step to help establish a future leadership fellowship track within Geriatrics and Palliative Care fellowship programs.

# SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS:

Thirty-three key informants were interviewed, including national experts in the field of Geriatrics and/or Palliative care as well as former fellows who have graduated from Mount Sinai's Geriatric and Palliative Care Fellowship program. In total, 19 experts and 14 former fellows were interviewed. These interviews were conducted via video and/or phone conference over six months. Subsequent participants were recruited via the "snowball method," i.e. asking key informants to suggest other leaders in the field.

# DESCRIPTION:

Key informants (N= 33) participated in qualitative interviews that ranged from 15-60 minutes. Interview questions were formulated by both a created taskforce for this needs assessment and based on...
