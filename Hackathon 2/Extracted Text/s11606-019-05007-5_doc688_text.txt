# NEEDS AND OBJECTIVES:

1. To identify barriers to resident attendance to noon-conference educational sessions
2. To improve the quality of noon-conference
3. To engage attending physicians in noon-conference sessions relating to medical decision making

# SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS:

Internal Medicine Residency programs utilize noon conference as a key opportunity for formal education for residents. In response to low attendance at our noon conferences, we distributed a survey to our residents assessing conference quality and composition as well as barriers to attendance and implemented changes based on the results of the survey.

# DESCRIPTION:

Main barriers included patient care obligations (24% of respondents), answering pages (22%), and rounds continuing near or through the beginning of conference (17%). 69% of residents reported attending conference less than 60% of the time. 61% felt guilty for not attending. 86% of residents agreed they would benefit more from conferences if attendings handled their pagers. Comments indicated that faculty attendance and participation at conferences would make the sessions more educationally robust. Interactive conferences and conferences that focused on medical decision-making were more popular than standard didactics.

# EVALUATION:

In response to survey results, we developed a two-pronged approach to 1) revise and improve our curriculum and 2) address the barriers to attendance. We changed the format of case reports to focus on a medical decision-making teaching point rather than the diagnosis of a rare disease. We introduced a new "Case Series" conference in which senior residents present a challenging case specifically to a panel of faculty. We revived journal club with a new format including pre-session discussion questions and interactive small group discussions. We added a new "High Value Care" conference to introduce educational opportunities pertaining to optimizing resource utilization. We moved much of the core curriculum to a new "Afternoon School" series - a small group based interactive learning series designed to replace standard didactics on high yield topics. We started tracking attendance using a QR code scanned from mobile devices. We revised faculty expectations to include completing rounds thirty minutes prior to conference and strongly encouraged them to attend conferences and hold their residents' pagers. We scheduled educational conferences in the scheduling software to reinforce attendance expectations and empower residents to show attendings their scheduled obligations.

# DISCUSSION / REFLECTION / LESSONS LEARNED:

Post-intervention survey data is pending. Preliminary data demonstrate clearly higher conference attendance with increased faculty and resident engagement. Residents responded positively to faculty participation in the medical decision-making conferences.

# ADVOCACY 101: A CURRICULUM TO ENGAGE PHYSICIAN TRAINEES IN HEALTHCARE ADVOCACY AND ANALYSIS OF ITS IMPACT

Andrea S. Christopher1, 2; Magni Hamso3, 1. 1Boise Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Boise, ID; 2University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, WA; 3University of Washington Boise Internal Medicine Residency, Boise, ID. (Control ID #3187147)

# NEEDS AND OBJECTIVES:

Over 90% of physicians believe community participation and collective advocacy are very important. Professional organizations highlight training in advocacy skills as a means to improve population health. Movements such as #whitecoatsforblacklives demonstrate trainee interest in advocacy. However, few opportunities exist for physician trainees to learn advocacy skills. We present our Advocacy 101 curriculum, which seeks to empower physician trainees from multiple community training programs in Boise, Idaho with the knowledge and skills to engage in healthcare advocacy. This curriculum is novel due to the inclusion of both undergraduate and graduate level physician trainees from multiple specialties. Advocacy 101 objectives are:

1. Appreciate the physician's role as advocate for patients in the healthcare system, both locally and nationally
2. Gain concrete skills in advocacy and leadership - including speaking with legislators, writing and publishing op eds, and conducting research to inform advocacy
3. Practice advocacy during the Idaho state legislative session.

# SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS:

We invite participation in Advocacy 101 from University of Washington (UW) medical students, Family Medicine Residency of Idaho residents, UW Boise Internal Medicine residents, and UW Psychiatry Idaho Advanced Track residents. About 20 trainees attend at least one session during each delivery year.

# DESCRIPTION:

Through an elective series of six 1.5 hour seminars, trainees learn about the history of health reform; discuss the role of physicians as advocates; identify local issues in the state legislature that affect them and their patients; practice writing op-eds and interacting with the media; learn how to most effectively interact with legislators; and learn how to use research to inform advocacy. The curriculum runs concurrent with the Idaho legislative session from January to March, in order to maximize exposure to active policy issues.

# EVALUATION:

We conduct a pre and post survey of Advocacy 101 participants, which started during the pilot of the curriculum in 2017. Using a 5 point Likert scale, participants reflect on their knowledge of national and local health policy, confidence in various advocacy skills, and personal views about the role of advocacy in their careers. At the course conclusion, trainees showed the most growth in their access to a community of physicians interested in advocacy, knowledge of local health policy issues, experience engaging in advocacy and confidence in speaking with a legislator.

# DISCUSSION / REFLECTION / LESSONS LEARNED:

Preliminary data analysis shows that as a result of this course, physician trainees reported more knowledge, skills and experience engaging in advocacy. We additionally identify benefits from exposing trainees from different levels of training and specialties to this content together, including collaboration between trainees and faculty from medical education programs across the region and growing the population of physician advocates for rural and medically underserved populations in Idaho.

# NEEDS AND OBJECTIVES:

Advocating for the promotion of societal health is a core professional activity. We propose that formal training of physicians in the knowledge, skills, and attitudes of effective advocacy.
