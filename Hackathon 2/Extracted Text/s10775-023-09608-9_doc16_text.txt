and even other countries. Lastly, the scale’s instructions asked participants to think of previous or potential future jobs, which may have affected the data collection due to memory or expectation biases. Future studies still need to test the measurement invariance of the MME across different employment situations.

# Conclusions

This study describes validity and reliability evidence of the MME in a sample of unemployed persons in Algarve, Portugal. CFA corroborated the original factor structure, with the four subscales meeting good-to-excellent reliability. The social capital and networking subscale’s AVE was low, which might be related to the ambiguity of item 12. Associations with career self-efficacy, life projects, future time orientation, and life satisfaction provided validity evidence based on the associations with related measures. Therefore, in addition to describing validity and reliability evidence of the MME among unemployed persons, the study contributes to the literature by introducing empirical models on the relations between employability resources, and motivational and emotional features.
