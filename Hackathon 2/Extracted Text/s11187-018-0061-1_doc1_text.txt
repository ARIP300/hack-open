# Factors Associated with Venturing

Factors associated with venturing such as regulatory-focus (Tumasjan and Braun 2012; Hmieleski and Baron 2008), affect and passion (Baron et al. 2012; Cardon et al. 2012; Gielnik et al. 2017). Recently, a relatively new and growing conversation has emerged—that involving conventionally dark or pathologized constructs that may be positively associated with entrepreneurship. Among the most prominent, and previously suggested in the popular press (Archer 2014; The Economist 2012), is attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Characterized by disinhibition, ADHD is indicated by impulsivity, hyperactivity, and problems with attentional regulation (APA 2013).

The theoretical and practical relevance of the above to entrepreneurship has recently been discussed (Verheul et al. 2015, 2016; Thurik et al. 2016; Wiklund et al. 2016, 2017, 2018; Lerner 2016; Lerner et al. 2018a, b, c; Miller and Le Brenton-Miller 2016). In particular, a number of studies drawing on the ADHD literature have emerged, suggesting a positive association between ADHD-related behavior and entrepreneurship, including an increased likelihood of entrepreneurial intentions (Verheul et al. 2015), venturing (Verheul et al. 2016), and entrepreneurial orientation (Thurik et al. 2016). These and related studies provide an important basis for the present investigation. In essence, they deal with behavioral tendencies that at the high end of the spectrum might be indicative of ADHD or of other disorders. With limited exception (discussed later), recent empirical research, while grounded in the clinical construct and literature of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, has yet to empirically examine ADHD—a diagnosed clinical condition. In other words, while predicated on prior research on the (clinical) condition of ADHD, the emerging entrepreneurship research has yet to examine whether the condition of ADHD is significantly linked to a higher propensity for entrepreneurial intentions and action. We contribute to recent theory about a positive ADHD—entrepreneurship link by providing a simple theoretically—empirically aligned test of the connection between ADHD and entrepreneurship.

The present work offers a number of contributions. It foments the emergent scholarly interest in the link between mental conditions and entrepreneurship (e.g., Wiklund et al. 2018) by focusing on a common condition that affects millions of adults worldwide (de Graaf et al. 2008), and that may be over-represented in entrepreneurial environments. With the overarching aim of testing whether ADHD is indeed linked to entrepreneurship, we go beyond recent research relating behavior that might be indicative of ADHD to entrepreneurship (Lerner 2016; Verheul et al. 2015, 2016; Thurik et al. 2016; Wiklund et al. 2017). Based on the reported large-scale study involving attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, we test whether ADHD is linked to an increased propensity for both entrepreneurial intentions and action. Grounding the aforementioned, and in conjunction with related entrepreneurship research (e.g., Lerner et al. 2018a, c), this work offers a novel basis for entrepreneurship theory, future research, and practice.

# 2 Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder

# 2.1 ADHD—the Condition

Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder is a common clinical condition, defined by impulsive, hyperactive, and inattentive behavior (APA 2013), affecting individuals of all ages worldwide. With a full discussion of clinical diagnostic criteria beyond the scope of this paper, for ADHD to exist, the impulsive, hyperactive, and inattentive behavior must be pervasive, enduring, and—to an age inappropriate frequency and magnitude—materially impairing normal functioning (APA 2013). Adult ADHD is well-established in scientific literature (Barkley et al. 2008; Kessler et al. 2005, 2007) and is known to affect organizations and vocational behavior (Bozionelos and Bozionelos 2013; de Graaf et al. 2008; Halbesleben et al. 2013; Kessler et al. 2009).

Like other disorders, ADHD is diagnosed by a licensed clinician (such as a clinical psychologist or psychiatrist), based on a battery of psychological tests and other data. It also requires differential diagnosis, meaning that the clinician must judge that the behavior and impairment consistent with ADHD is not attributable to another condition or cause (e.g., mania, substance abuse, or say distractibility and impulsivity due to other reasons such as stress, a lack of sleep, or being in the midst of a difficult divorce). Suffice to say, there is no single test, let alone any simple psychometric measure, able to determine if an individual has ADHD.

ADHD is, by definition, a clinical construct and disorder, rooted in extensive clinical literature, which over the past 30+ years has established the validity.
