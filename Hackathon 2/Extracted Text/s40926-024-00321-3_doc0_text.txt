# Abstract

Elizabeth Anderson claims that the prevailing culture of business is one of domination. “Most workplace governments in the United States are dictatorships, in which bosses don’t merely govern workers; they dominate them” (2017, p. xxii; italics in the original). If this diagnosis is correct, then the culture of business poses a significant threat to human liberty, as each year millions of people in the employ of businesses spend hundreds or thousands of hours on the job. This essay provides a further argument supporting Anderson’s analysis, by extending her treatment of Adam Smith and drawing on his claim about the potentially mind-numbing effects on workers of extreme division of labor. Smith’s analysis, though consistent with Anderson’s, implies that the problem is more worrisome than she allows, and accordingly that Anderson’s own remedy might be insufficient. Our Anderson/Smith argument suggests that worker unfreedom might warrant more aggressive institutional remedy.

Elizabeth Anderson has recently argued that there is a significant lacuna in our thought about human freedom. Most discussions of freedom are concerned with the role of government—its proper aims, scope, authorities, and so on. If freedom, however defined, is an important moral or political goal, then understanding how states should protect and nurture freedom is a paramount concern. Yet Anderson argues that focusing on the role government plays in human political freedom has led us to overlook a key area of life in which human beings are unfree: business. Anderson puts the point provocatively: “Most workplace governments in the United States are dictatorships, in which bosses govern in ways that are largely unaccountable to those who are governed. They don’t merely govern workers; they dominate them.”
