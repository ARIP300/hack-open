# MEASURES OF SUCCESS

We analyzed the number of PPI prescriptions per month, indications for prescriptions, and the rate of inappropriate prescriptions per month.

# FINDINGS TO DATE

70 patient charts were analyzed over six months pre-intervention, and 245 charts were analyzed over eight months post-intervention. Monthly number of prescriptions fluctuated; however, the rate of inappropriate PPI prescriptions has steadily declined since beginning of intervention. Pre-intervention, a substantial number of PPIs were inappropriately prescribed (77%). Of these prescriptions, a majority (67%) was for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), followed by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use (9%), and unspecified dyspepsia (7%). The most common mistake in GERD and dyspepsia prescriptions was providing a several month supply and refills without close interval follow-up to assess treatment efficacy. Preexisting NSAID use as documented reason for PPI prescription for ulcer prophylaxis was commonly inappropriate due to young patient age with low bleeding risk. Post-intervention, inappropriate PPI prescriptions decreased to 53%, of which 61% was attributed to GERD, 5% to NSAID use, and 8% to dyspepsia.

# KEY LESSONS FOR DISSEMINATION

Many resident physicians lack adequate knowledge on indications for long-term PPI use and unintentionally over-prescribe. With a structured deprescribing tool and enhanced awareness, residents were able to reduce inappropriate prescriptions significantly. Primary care providers can use a similar intervention at their practice to reduce unnecessary PPI prescriptions.

# MEASURES OF SUCCESS

The number of referrals generated by providers to the community-based organization was tracked over a six month period. Provider-perceived barriers were assessed via survey administration.

# FINDINGS TO DATE

Over the course of a six-month period, five referrals were generated from our clinic to the CBO. 69% (22 out of 32) of resident providers completed the survey. 45% of respondents (n=10) were unaware of the CBO and services offered, 55% (n=12) did not know the criteria for a referral, and 25% (n=5) reported making referrals to the CBO. Providers noted that the most common reasons for patient refusal of services when offered was patient preference to try to manage their disease on their own and perceived time commitment.

# KEY LESSONS FOR DISSEMINATION

The data above highlights that provider unawareness is a key barrier in connecting patients to community-based resources. Neither email reminders nor postings in clinic were high-yield contributors in generating referrals, as evidenced by the number of resident providers who were either unaware of the CBO or did not know the criteria for a referral. Key next steps include engaging other members of the clinic team in advocating for the CBO within the daily work flow, ensuring consistency of daily reminders at all huddles, and addressing reasons for patient refusal when a referral is offered.

# STATEMENT OF PROBLEM OR QUESTION

Though clinical-community partnerships have increasingly emerged to address social determinant barriers for patients, best practices to engage providers and patients with such services are not well studied.

# OBJECTIVES OF PROGRAM/INTERVENTION

To understand provider-perceived barriers in engaging patients with community health coach services. To increase referrals to community health coaching services.

# DESCRIPTION OF PROGRAM/INTERVENTION

The Ryan Adair Community Health Center is a Federally Qualified Health Center (FQHC) in Manhattan that serves as a training site for our internal medicine residents who rotate through the clinic in quartiles every two weeks. The center recently partnered with a local community-based organization (CBO) which provides free community health coaching services to patients with common chronic conditions. A resident physician-champion was selected to spend time with the CBO and focus on ways to create awareness of this service among resident providers. To increase referrals, the physician-champion disseminated information about the CBO services.

# STATEMENT OF PROBLEM OR QUESTION

In implementing an innovative home-based care model, Hospitalization at Home (HaH) programs face the dual challenge of ensuring high quality patient care as well as seamless coordination within the interdisciplinary team and with contracted service vendors (CSVs), who perform integral functions.

# OBJECTIVES OF PROGRAM/INTERVENTION

1. Develop an intuitive adverse event and incident reporting tool 2. Engage interdisciplinary team members in identifying and addressing key systems issues 3. Track our progress and report findings.

# DESCRIPTION OF PROGRAM/INTERVENTION

HaH provides hospital-level care to patients in their homes. Our team provides care alongside CSVs who assist with nursing, labs, imaging, durable medical equipment, medication and oxygen delivery, and patient transportation. After discharging patients from the acute hospital episode, we follow them clinically for a short "plus" period. We developed a customized Web-based Incident Reporting System (WIRS) for the team to report both.
