a broad range of negative work conditions can undermine the human, social, and physical capital beneficial for recovery (see Table 3), as well as the broader aspects of work‑related (e.g., job satisfaction), physical, mental, and social well‑being (Bannai & Tamakoshi, 2014; Barling et al., 2005; Chiaburu & Harrison, 2008; Clarke, 2019; Frone & Blais, 2020; Gisler et al., 2018; Goh et al., 2017; Jackson & Frame, 2018; Lundberg, 2015).

# Research Proposition 1

Negative work conditions will decrease the likelihood of (a) initiating unassisted and treatment‑assisted recovery efforts, (b) achieving or sustaining abstinence, and (c) achieving broad recovery outcomes such as growth in positive recovery capital and improved physical, psychological, and social well‑being.

# Workplace physical availability

—Availability theories of substance use (Single, 1988; Smart, 1980) propose that physical access to substances and ease of use may promote higher levels of substance use and misuse, which can increase the likelihood of SUDs and act as a trigger for craving and use among those with an active SUD or in recovery. Physical availability of alcohol and drugs at work represents the ease of obtaining these substances at work and bringing them into the workplace or using them during the workday (Ames & Moore, 2016; Frone, 2012, 2013, 2019). Research indicates that the physical availability of psychoactive substances at work, including access in specific jobs (e.g., bartenders, nurses, physicians, pharmacists), is associated with substance use and misuse during the workday and away from work (Ames & Moore, 2016; Frone, 2013, 2019). Although research on the association of work‑place substance availability to other dimensions of the recovery process is lacking, general substance use research supports an association between physical availability of substances and both treatment dropout (Jacobson, 2004) and posttreatment recurrence of substance use during recovery (Tate et al., 2006; Tucker et al., 1991). Based on this limited research, we propose that among employees with an active SUD, workplace physical availability of substances may be used to rationalize and support their substance use. Also, among people with an active SUD or in recovery, work‑place physical availability may act as an environmental trigger for substance use and undermine a person’s motivation to enter or remain in recovery, respectively, whether treatment‑assisted or unassisted. This process may further erode the recovery capital needed to initiate and sustain the SUD recovery process.

# Research Proposition 2

Physical availability of substances at work will decrease the likelihood of (a) initiating unassisted and treatment‑assisted recovery efforts, (b) achieving or sustaining abstinence, and (c) achieving broad recovery outcomes such as growth in positive recovery capital and improved physical, psychological, and social well‑being.

# Workplace substance use norms and rituals

—General theories of social influence and learning (Cialdini & Trost, 1998) suggest that perceived social norms may be critical antecedents of substance misuse and disorders. Research shows that social norms supporting alcohol and illicit drug use before or during the workday predict higher alcohol and illicit drug use on and off the job (Ames & Moore, 2016; Frone, 2013, 2019). For example, a study of newly hired sales professionals in China showed that exposure to heavy drinking among veteran sales professionals and clients was associated with heavy drinking among the new.
