# INFERIOR MESENTERIC VEIN THROMBOSIS SECONDARY TO ACUTE SIGMOID DIVERTICULITIS A RARE COMPLICATION.

Muqsita Nashat; Saba Mushtaq. Mercy Nazareth Hospital, Philadelphia, PA. (Control ID #3178637)

# LEARNING OBJECTIVE #1:

Diagnose and treat septic thrombophlebitis of inferior mesenteric vein secondary to acute diverticulitis.

# CASE:

A 50-year-old male presented to the emergency room with worsening left lower quadrant abdominal pain of two days duration associated with subjective fever and diarrhea. Three weeks prior to his presentation, he was diagnosed with acute diverticulitis confirmed by abdominal CT scan and completed a seven-day course of Ciprofloxacin and Metronidazole. Physical exam revealed a temperature of 36.4C, pulse 136/min, BP 140/85, tenderness in the left lower quadrant without any peritoneal signs. There was no leukocytosis and a repeat CT of the abdomen showed worsening sigmoid diverticulitis with new septic thrombophlebitis of the inferior mesenteric vein extending to the Porto splenic confluence. Patient was admitted, placed on bowel rest, treated with intravenous Piperacillin/Tazobactam, fluids, Heparin drip and oral Vancomycin as his stool for C. diff toxin gene by PCR was positive. His blood cultures were negative and flow cytometry showed no evidence for a lympho or myeloproliferative disorder. Due to persistent abdominal pain, he underwent hemicolectomy and a coloproctostomy. Pathology of colon showed acute diverticulitis with pericolonic abscess. The patient was discharged home and advised to complete the remaining 14 days of oral Vancomycin and six-month course of Coumadin.

# IMPACT/DISCUSSION:

Clinical cases of Inferior Mesenteric Vein thrombosis (IMV) complicating acute diverticulitis is rare and comprises of 4-11% of cases but carries a 15-23% risk of mortality. Acute diverticulitis can cause inflammation of IMV by peri colonic abscess and thrombosis occurs by inflammatory mediators causing endothelial injury and activation of coagulation cascade. Sigmoid diverticulitis is the most common causative etiology of thrombophlebitis of IMV accounting for 30% of cases, the remaining other causes are appendicitis (19%), IBD (6%), pancreatitis (5%), infectious enteritis (4%), bowel perforation and malignancies (6%). There is high mortality in cases complicated by hepatic abscess or bowel ischemia. The clinical presentation of septic thrombophlebitis of IMV is insidious with vague symptoms delaying early diagnosis and therefore requires a high index of suspicion. CT scan of the abdomen with contrast is generally the first test of choice with direct visualization of endoluminal thrombus. Bacteremia is typically polymicrobial with E. coli, Bacteroides, Streptococcus Viridians, Proteus Mirabilis and Klebsiella Pneumonia being the most common pathogens. Sterile blood cultures in our patient can be explained by the prior use of antibiotics. Treatment with broad spectrum antibiotics and systemic anticoagulation often has a favorable outcome when compared to treatment with antibiotics alone.

# CONCLUSION:

This case illustrates the fact that IMV thrombosis though a rare complication of acute diverticulitis requires a high index of suspicion for a prompt diagnosis and to prevent complications.

# INFLIXIMAB-INDUCED PULMONARY EMBOLISM.

# LEARNING OBJECTIVE #1:

Recognize infliximab (Remicade) as a cause of pulmonary embolism.

# CASE:

A 20 years old African American male with a past medical history of diabetes type 1 and recently diagnosed Crohn disease 6 months prior presentation actively on mesalamine and infliximab infusions. His last infusion was shortly before the presentation. He presented to the emergency department with chest pain and back pain. On examination, he was tachycardic with a heart rate of 139. Laboratory investigations showed elevated D-dimer, EKG showed sinus tachycardia, and CT of the chest with contrast showed pulmonary embolism involving the left lower lobe segmental and subsegmental vessels. He denied any history of smoking, recent immobilization, surgery, travel, or any personal or family history of clotting disorders. He was diagnosed with provoked pulmonary embolism and started on IV heparin infusion. He showed improvement and was sent home with a subcutaneous anticoagulant for a period of 3 months.

# IMPACT/DISCUSSION:

This case demonstrates the potential pulmonary embolism side effect of a commonly prescribed anti-TNF infliximab. Remicade, trade name for Infliximab, a chimerical monoclonal antibody that works against tumor necrosis factor TNF. It's used for a different array of autoimmune disease. It can't be given by mouth because the digestive system will destroy the drug, and hence, it's given in intravenous infusions. Although most patients treated with infliximab experience side effects related to suppression of the immune system, thromboembolic side effects are very low. The most common side effects are serious infections (fungal, bacterial, or viral), reactivation of tuberculosis, reactivation of hepatitis, drug-induced lupus, and increase the risk for certain types of cancer. A case report has identified the occurrence of pulmonary embolism during infliximab treatment. The mechanism by which infliximab causes pulmonary embolism is still not very clear and hence further research is warranted.

# CONCLUSION:

Although infliximab is associated with multiple common side effects, we should be aware of its thromboembolic aptitude. Close attention should be given to IBD patients started on infliximab infusion for any symptoms of pulmonary embolism or deep vein thrombosis DVT.

# INFLUENZA-A, A RARE CAUSE OF DIFFUSE ALVEOLAR HEMORRHAGE.

Deep Patel. Brookwood Baptist Health, Birmingham, AL. (Control ID #3186005)

# LEARNING OBJECTIVE #1:

Recognize that Influenza A is a rare but important cause of diffuse alveolar hemorrhage.

# LEARNING OBJECTIVE #2:

Recognize the important aspects of diagnosis and treatment of Influenza A.

# CASE:

A 59-year-old African American male with a past medical history of hypertension, hemolytic anemia, thrombocytosis, and DVT presented with 1 day of fever up to 102F, shortness of breath, congestion, and palpitations. No prior surgical history. Family history significant for myocardial infarction in brother in his 60's. Social history significant for prior tobacco use. Physical exam revealed increased work of breathing, bilateral wheezing, crackles, and tachycardia. Pertinent Lab findings included WBC of 12.1, H&H 7.6/25.3, platelet count 93, Creatinine 1.58, lactic acid 4.0, troponin 0.141, Procalcitonin 23.53. Chest X-ray was concerning for bilateral pneumonia vs. pulmonary edema. Rapid Flu test was negative. Cultures were obtained and IV fluids, Azithromycin, and Piperacillin/tazobactam were started. Repeat X-ray was concerning for ARDS, so pulmonary service was consulted. Overnight his respiratory distress worsened and he was intubated. The next morning, he had bloody respiratory secretions and bronchoscopy revealed diffuse alveolar hemorrhage. Vasculitis labs were sent. Respiratory virus panel for Influenza A was positive and Tamiflu was initiated. Vasculitis work-up including ANA, ANCA, and Anti GBM was negative. Influenza was considered the cause of the diffuse alveolar hemorrhage.

# IMPACT/DISCUSSION:

Influenza-A - particularly H1N1 - is a viral illness associated with potential serious complications. One complication is diffuse alveolar hemorrhage. The first case of H1N1 was reported in March 2009 and by June 2009 it was a pandemic. It affected all ages, however death mostly occurred in those between 30-50 years of age. Although a rapid flu test and respiratory virus panel may be positive, real time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction is the diagnostic.
