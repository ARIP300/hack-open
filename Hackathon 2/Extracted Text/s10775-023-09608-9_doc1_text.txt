a valuable solution (Fuertes et al., 2021). To this end, it is necessary to have career resource assessment instruments with good psychometric properties. In this sense, we intend to evaluate the validity and reliability of a multidimensional measure of employability in a sample of unemployed persons in Algarve.

# Employability

Employability has been studied in psychology (Di Fabio, 2017) and management (Moore, 2019), among other disciplines. Despite the lack of consensus on its definition (Fuertes et al., 2021), the current literature seems to be complementary rather than contradictory (Guilbert et al., 2015). Research on employability has changed over time (Van der Heijden et al., 2018), with theoretical approaches following micro-level perspectives (focused on individual characteristics), meso-level perspectives (focused on intra-organizational flexibility of employees), and macro-level perspectives (focused on the needs of industry and society). In psychology, employability has been mostly studied from a micro-level perspective. An old psychological definition of employability advocates that the concept entails a multidimensional construct embracing career identity, personal adaptability, and social and human capital (Fugate et al., 2004). Fugate et al. (2004) identified conceptual commonalities between the dimensions and conceived employability as an active adaptability specific to work.

More recently, psychologists have acknowledged the need to combine the micro-, meso-, and macro-level perspectives on employability (Guilbert et al., 2015). For instance, Lo Presti and Pluviano (2016) developed a heuristic model on employability orientation and activities. At the micro-level, employability is conceived as the personal resources that favor professional development and, consequently, career success. At the meso-level, making sense of previous and future work experiences is fundamental for acquiring skills to improve formal and informal career networks, and explore social environments. Lastly, at the macro-level, work experiences and external factors function as antecedents; career success as a proximal result; whereas job search, life satisfaction, and commitment are distal results of employability (Lo Presti & Pluviano, 2016). Therefore, employability results from dynamic interactions between individual characteristics (e.g., age), personal resources (e.g., self-efficacy), and external factors (e.g., employment policy; Lent & Brown, 2020). A positive interaction results in the ability to achieve a valued career path, as well as improve oneâ€™s career development to promote employability (Di Fabio, 2017; Fuertes et al., 2021; Guilbert et al., 2015; Lo Presti & Pluviano, 2016).

According to Cheng et al. (2020), this employability definition complements the career development concept. Career development is an intentional process that allows people to increase awareness of goals, expectations, work experiences, career networks, skills, opportunities, and barriers in the environment. Since the strategies for developing employability resources coincide with those for career development, employability resources can be considered a means of career development in themselves. Thus, the development of these resources may promote
