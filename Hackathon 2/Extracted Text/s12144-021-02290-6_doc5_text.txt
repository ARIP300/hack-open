government is working for the community’s good (Kim et al., 1998). As therefore, most people follow the social distancing SOPs as they are afraid of the heavy fines. Meanwhile, people in low-context cultures countries value personal interests and individuality. For low-context cultures such as France and Germany, they act based on their beliefs on the best way to proceed (Kim et al., 1998). For example, people in France still hang out in parks and outside cafes after the government announced a lockdown and encouraged people to stay at home (Baker, 2020).

On the education front, the Ministry of Education introduced online learning for the students due to the closure of all schools and universities (Povera & Yunus, 2020). This policy is similar to those of Taiwan and Singapore, with the aim of preventing mass gathering and reducing the risk of infection. The curve was flattened since 29 April 2020, and this demonstrated that the MCO with SOPs implemented by the government was producing a positive result (Kanyakumari, 2020; Tan, 2020). In comparison, the pre-MCO model simulation highlighted that the MCO could minimize the number of active COVID-19 cases by 99.1% (Gill et al., 2020). Malaysia succeeded in flattening the infection curve of COVID-19 on 17 May 2020 (Song & Ling, 2020). The situation further improved with an affirmation that there was only one imported case reported on 1 July 2020, the lowest figure since the MCO was imposed, and the number of infected cases remained in two digits until 7 September 2020. In brief, the underlying success of Malaysia in combating the pandemic at the early stage was attributed to various enabling factors: total lockdown, closing of borders, mandatory quarantine, heavy fines for not following SOPs, risk communication via social media, social distancing, and online learning.

# Success-Disabling Factors

The third wave of COVID-19 started in September 2020 with the number of positive cases increasing sharply and hitting three digits on 8 September 2020. The number of daily COVID-19 new cases was on the rise from 8 September 2020 until 30 January 2021. As shown in Fig. 2, Malaysia reported more than 1000 new daily cases for the first time on 24 October, with 1228 cases; and more than 2000 cases on 24 November 2020, with 2188 cases. Unfortunately, Malaysia hit more than 3000 daily new cases, with 3027 confirmed positive, on 7 January 2021, which escalated to 4029 cases within two weeks, on 16 January 2021. Fearing further rise, the government reintroduced the MCO on 13 January 2021. There was a sudden surge of COVID-19 cases even though Malaysia had successfully controlled the infectious disease in the second quarter of 2020 as mentioned above, why? What caused the COVID-19 active cases trending upward again? The paragraphs below critically analyze the sudden spike of COVID-19 cases from September 2020 to April 2021.

The spike of COVID-19 cases since September 2020 was triggered by an election in the Sabah state (East Malaysia); people who were infected during the time travelled back to West Malaysia after the election (Geraldine, 2020). This happened as the politicians were having mass gatherings without following the SOPs - many of them did not wear face masks and did not observe social distancing during the election campaign period (Sukumaran, 2020). This scenario was different from that of Singapore when the country held the general election on 10 July 2020 with strict adherence to SOPs. The political party leaders were only allowed to run the online campaigns as all mass gatherings and physical rallies were banned (Murad, 2020). To safeguard the voting citizens’ safety, the election department formulated various contingency plans such as strict SOPs on hygiene, different timing of voting following the age groups (high-risk group and low-risk group), social distancing in the voting centers, reducing the number of voters for each station, and extension of polling hours (Government of Singapore, 2020). There are a vast number of dissimilarities between Singapore and Malaysia when it comes to handling the SOPs for the election during the COVID-19 period; the loose SOPs practiced in the Sabah election led to another wave of infection in Malaysia.

There was also an epidemic of COVID-19 in the Sabah detention centers, where the undocumented immigrants from the Philippines and Indonesia were kept in October 2020. This happened due to the overcrowding in the lock-ups, and the state government failed to practice social distancing for the detainees (The Straits Times, 2021). In November 2020, the Teratai cluster that was linked to Top Glove Corporation, the world’s biggest glove manufacturer, caused more than 1000 infected cases, most of whom were foreign workers (Salim, 2020). The lack of compliance with the SOPs in the manufacturing sector and the absence of clear SOPs were the main reasons that had led to an increase in the number of COVID-19 cases. Shankar (2021) posited that these companies’ human resource departments failed to follow the SOPs, and the government authorities did not closely monitor the situations. An estimated 3 million documented and undocumented migrant workers are affected by the pandemic, in one way or another (Lim, 2020a). On the other hand, Singapore reported that almost 47% of the foreign workers had been infected with COVID-19; however, the Ministry of Manpower came out with clear SOPs during mid-2020 for the business and industrial sectors to slow down the transmission (Lim, 2020b). Here are some examples of the procedures: compulsory systematic testing for all the foreign workers; maintaining a high standard of the hygiene conditions in the workers’ dormitory; and employer-provided transportation from the workplace to the dormitory. These are some of the differences between Singapore and Malaysia in handling the migrant workers. To sum up, Malaysia has not been taking proactive actions in formulating strict SOPs and executing them accordingly during the early stage of infection.
